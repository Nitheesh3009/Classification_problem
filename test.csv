0,"I found for the road it just was missing something that sense of occasion.
My standard street bike I ride daily is the MT10SP so coming from that I was a little disappointed.
Agree for track amazing but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a road bike so needs to be more road focused like the earlier Speed Twins were."
1,"I have no interest in change my 2018RS for this one,  it‚Äôs every thing I need and more"
2,Was thinking of buying a 2021 but hardly ever manage to get to the track. Now assessing 2020 options.
3,Shame that Triumph have made the new Speedy a little too track orientated with that setup. I have just watched a full review of the new 1100 Tuono Factory and the guy could not stop gushing over it. He actually went as far as to say it was the best bike he has ever tested. And it looks gorgeous.
4,"Very tempted to get rid of my MT10SP for this bike , decent fuel consumption more power and does not sound like a diesel tractor unlike my Yam.Far superior in so many ways good job Triumph."
5,I just bought a 2019 speed rs. You don't need anymore power than that for road use. Plus I like the looks better and how it feels bigger than a street triple.
6,old bike is brilliant
7,"Brilliant Bike but I doubt you can use more than a third of the performance except on a club track day(s). I'd opt for a BMW R9T, sensible power with shaft drive"
8,"I think the 17+ Aprilia Tuono is a lot more bike for your money in this bracket-bought mine for 11k with under 10,000 miles, an exhaust and zero damage. 175+ hp, incredibly comfortable, more stylish (to me), proven powertrain, amazing sound, TFT dash, modern electronics‚Ä¶its the best bike I‚Äôve ever owned."
9,"I would recommend you try a 2022 BMW S1000R SPORT. It has everything which you advise the Triumph RS SPEED TRIPLE HAS but delivers it better it has a 6.5 TFT screen which is far easier to use than the Triumph and has more information. The bike is set up like the Triumph for a sportier ride as you are encouraged to have a slight lean forward towards the flat bars whilst offering a slightly more open riding triangle (seat you move on back to front and lean off) which alongside the cruise control, heated grips, up/ down shifter, hill hold  assist, self cancelling indicators and 80% of 111 Nm/ 86 ft/lb torque coming in from 3,000 makes (165 bhp at 11,000 revs) the bike suitable for commuting/ city riding, longer journeys and as you would put it canyon carving (I live in the UK). I have mine in racing red with red stripe on the wheels and choose to add  the Tyre Pressure Monitoring System all backed up by a 3 yr Warranty from BMW and an excellent dealer network. I am constantly attracting positive comments from passersby which is nice to hear others appreciate your bike but even if that did not happen the smile I get before, during and after riding my bike, the pops and crackles that happen when in Dynamic Pro mode (there are 4 riding modes Pro being customisable to your personal needs) just makes me giggle. I am very pleased I got mine and I believe you and many others who enjoy motorcycling will likewise enjoy one as well. Give it a try, I look forward to your opinion on a BMW S1000R Sport."
10,"I think 22 mt10 looks cooler, cross-plane sounds cooler, and 4000 less $$$. No brainer for me"
11,"Sat on one the other day, felt like I could get in trouble üòà on a bike like that with how sporty it felt."
12,"Heck now. More POWER! Haha. The only thing extra I want is a windscreen. But I agree that midrange is much better that top end. The option for a touring screen is a must for daily use. So far, I‚Äôm keeping the MT10. Well until the next gen.

"
13,"I had the previous model and sold because it was so harsh on poor UK roads. Perfect on the track or on a tour on perfect Spanish or Portuguese roads, but I just couldn't get it set up for the other 90% of my riding, so it's disappointing to know this is harsher still."
14,"Other than the useless 2"" pillion seat and 2000 model TFT dash...ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ Its a good bike indeed."
15,That mirror is pointless. I am sorry.
16,To heavy abs comes in to early
17,"It‚Äôs an amazing bike I own it but guys if you buy this bike and your iPhone user, you will be having issues getting connected to navigation system. As the bike doesn‚Äôt support iPhone device. That‚Äôs sad and bad‚Ä¶ üòû"
18,I would buy this bike just for way it looks - amazing beauty !
19,"Looks wise, I love it. Looking fwd to test riding one soon."
20,"Time for Hinckley to bring back some of those eye popping color options their famous for. And don't tell me their listening to customer feedback for dull, dark Asphalt grade paint choices. What's with bolting the seat cowl on and not being able to unlock the rear with a key too? Has it lost the USB?"
21,"I love how it looks ugly, unique and gorgeous all at the same time"
22,"Bike looks awesome üëçüòé
A macho looking super bike üëç‚ù§Ô∏è"
23,"I know the bike is monster and triumph makes some of the geat performing and looking bikes but dont know how they can agree with this face i hate it every time i see these. The body design is cool but one main front it looks kind of mehh ....ü§¶
Please triumph change it ..
The RR version with front fairing looks so much cooler ..."
24,Personally the face looks a bit too large.
25,Why it's look like ET.
26,that front number plate looks so ugly.
27,"If they slapped some fairings on it, I‚Äôd be first in line."
28,The Ugliest headlight of any bike on earth...
29,"I can never buy it cause that ugly headlight, what engineer thinks that looks good?"
30,"Aside from the funeral colors in the fog and the scrotum-level headlight (with only one low beam on), great bike!"
31," I like it very much! Too bad for the limited range of colors, a nice metallic white and for me it was almost perfect. I say almost because the electronic suspensions would have been great ... too bad!"
32,"Sooo beautiful! But I still dream of a Daytona 1050 or a worthy heir to the Sprint ST, in the more ""sporty"" version of the first generation 2005-2007"
33,"I bought a 2021 street triple R in February. I came from a 05' Roadking. I love my street triple. It is the most fun I've had in years. My only concern is the seat. I can ride comfortably for maybe 3 hours before I really need to stop and give my butt a rest. I am not experiencing the shifting into neutral problem on mine however.. I suggest if you want to save a few thousand dollars just go with the R. I also like having the analog tachometer. The R is a very good choice, so much fun!"
34,My Triumph is definitely better for warm weather but I will take it out if the temps are in the 50's.  The Kawasaki can be out in all weather.  The Triumph is a great second bike in my opinion.
35,This is the second review that says a negative about the ride quality. A bit of a let down because this bike will spend most of its time on the bumpy road. Adaptive suspension would have sorted that
36,"had a Street Triple RS and I felt that was too stiff for the rode with Ohlins, however Triumph launched an ‚ÄúR‚Äù version which was just about right, they should have pulled the same trick on the Speed Triple IMHO"
37,"Excellent review! 
However springs can be changed to soften up the suspension if you are a light and small person‚Ä¶"
38,"You can do something about suspension springs: You can change them, for a couple of hundred ¬£. If you want more track you can put a stiffer spring, if you want more touring a softer one and if you are not sure a progressive one... üôÇ But for a couple 200-300 is not a deal breaker in my book. For my pocket 3000-5000 extra euros for electronic suspension is a deal breaker though for sure..."
39,"Rode the bike today. Didn‚Äôt find the ride too hard as in the video though I am considerably heavier than the MCN pilot. Bike was amazing, real weapon. Ordered it there and then."
40,Test rode the new Speed today. I set the compression damping to the minimum +1 click on the rear shock and it was totally fine. Quality bike.
41,Shame about the springs. Really hope triumph offers a respring option (not that expensive too!) for a more plush setup. That said I'd love to see what one can do by taking some of the installed preload out considerably and taking out some comp damp.
42,"I can deal with a bit of suspension stiffness on the 1200 RS, hoping to pick one up soon."
43,I test rode this new Speed Triple & Street Triple RS back to back. Found the Street to be far more tangible & usable in stop and go Indian traffic conditions. Test ride both & see for yourself
44,"Was sooo looking forward to buying one. Finally got around to taking a test ride. Sorry, but the clunky transmission with no neutral makes this bike a no-go. If I were only on the twisties, then maybe, but if that were the case, I'd just ride my GSX-R1000. Need to be able to sit in traffic and having to hunt for neutral (and eventually give up) at every light, was inexcusable for a bike that costs $20k. Forget about my Sport bikes, my HARLEY has a better tranny than this bike :("
45,"I was one of the first to get a 1200RS in the UK. I've had many big bikes and like to ride them hard. Make no mistake this is the best handling hypernaked motorcycle you can buy today. My only regret is that triumph do not yet offer the semi active suspension they are installing on the new RR, as i would have paid the extra cash for it. My only two issues with the bike are first and foremost, it is an absolute proper pain in the ass to get into neutral and secondly I wished that Triumph had given us just 1 extra litre capacity for petrol as it's only 15.5 litres, however that seems to be the way all manufacturers are going unless you buy a touring bike. Other than that, believe you and me after spending nearly nine months with the RS it is utterly awesome and totally unflappable. It makes you feel like your a riding god, but what else did anyone expect....triumph don't make crap handling bikes ;-D"
46,Really hope triumph can sort that neutral situation out. Wouldn‚Äôt buy one until they do. I‚Äôd try putting on that Thruxton cowling fairing to cut down wind.
47,I m surprised by the amount of comments about finding neutral. Interestingly I owned a 2011 speed triple and I had the same issue. 
48,"I have this same issue on my daytona 675 with getting into neutral especially with racing boots on, like you said going from 2nd to neutral is easier but that‚Äôs very annoying when you‚Äôre stopping and going from light to light."
49,"The Speed Triple RS is a beautiful bike. But I'm with you on the neutral issue. I've been riding for over 11 years and I'm not paying over 21k for a bike that's giving me that kinda issue. Thing is I had a Triumph Daytona 675R and it NEVER gave me trouble getting into neutral. I honestly think the MT09 SP is the better bike. I believe it has all the features of the Speed Triple RS, besides the full Olins suspension. Plus the MT09 SP will cost you less than the RS."
50,"Me, and dozens of other Speed Triple riders have had 0 issue getting into neutral. Chase just got bad luck of the draw on a demo bike, or he simply didn't check the clutch cable freeplay."
51,"Had this bike for a few days. Had no issue with finding neutral. Cable clutches need to have the free play properly adjusted. If you find it hard to get into neutral, I‚Äôm pretty sure you didn‚Äôt take care to check the free play or most likely you didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a factor."
52,With all these new bikes and their horse power we'll have to find an air strip to ride them. It's becoming stupid.
53,I think that naked bikes should be about torque like super Duke not top speed 
54,"In India, this is the closest we would get to a ""Daytona"" experience, the other bikes that you mentioned are too expensive here (not available locally and need to be imported as CBU with 180% price tag) and like you said, not practical for road use, too much power for the traffic here."
55,"As an owner of the 1050, you have just confirmed two things in my mind: 1. if you don't do track days (how many people buy a bike with this primarily in mind?), this is the wrong choice for a Triumph urban Sports bike, and 2. its got more power than can realistically be used on the road, and the older versions are a far better choice. Shame that Triumph took such a successful blend of power, looks and plush road abilities, and turned the (only new) version into a primarily track-focused bike that, it seems doesn't have the charm, all-round abilities and enjoyment that the outgoing versions had. I suspect that the depreciation on these will be high when people who buy them are disappointed that they aren't as everyday-friendly and UK road usable as all the previous the 1050's. Long live the 1050's!"
56,"Love my 19 RS. Other than adding some padding or an aftermarket seat. And tweaking the tune, bigger sprockets and a power commander turns that 148hp to 170+hp(on the dyno) quite easily and gives a more comfortable ride. The thing is just a phenomenal ride!"
57,"I absolutely love my 07 speed triple! Although mine does have clip-ons, for my 6'4 body it's still a very comfortable bike to ride and I ride it most days to the office. I would say to whomever wants a raw feel of a bike unlike all the tech the newer models have I would recommend the 2005-2010 model speed triple. Me personally I wouldn't want a newer bike, since I love the raw feeling"
58,"Seams like Triumph hit a big one with this for the more sporty riders. They nailed the chassi, TFT screen, engine and powertrain. Its a ripper with those nice tyres."
59,You are spot on!! I have both the Super Duke R and the Streetfighter V4 S. To be honest they are much to much for the road as you said! I think I enjoyed my MT09 much more!! I'd love the SDR and the SFV4 rather with more torque and less speed! More to enjoy on the road and not to go to a track.... It is getting stupid now! Who want to start to enjoy a bike at 9000 rpm and up?? Regards!!
60,"2018 street triple RS. We both love the thing! The suspension, brakes, transmission; literally everything is amazing on it. Ton of fun!!"
61,"First time I've felt excited about a british motorcycle in a long time. They've always been like a half assed version of the japanese bikes, where everything is just less good. But now... it's definitely not too far, because they of any need to set their mark and in my eyes they've nailed it with that bike. I don't care about minor imperfections. I care about all the good things about the bike, which will outshine any minor things. If they can just stick to this recipe and stay in this ballpark, then this will have some lifespan. It even looks great, which is a first for me from the british side."
62,Now a days triumphs are lit

The package was strong before the price hike...but the much bigger concern is how triumph missed to give a hydrolic clutch on such a super premium bike with premium pricing...I have experienced the clutch on this bike...it's not just heavy but SUPER heavy...also how can triumph miss on a old school key access even tho when one can use the modern technology...I think people shud wait for the updated variant with this bike...buying this now doesn't make sense...becox this super heavy clutch will make u cry.."
64,"Almost 2000 miles on mine already (I have 2 other bikes taking my time too) and I absolutely love it. Added heated grips, flyscreen, and the tank bag. I tried the BMW, Ducati, Aprilia, Ktm. The triumph was most comfortable by far. Lots of comments about stiff suspension and neutral. They are actually sprung too soft and most people are bottoming out... and getting to neutral is not an issue for me. Who the hell is constantly trying to find neutral lmao??! Mine specifically goes in with a little effort. If the SF4 had cruise I might have went that way just because I like the looks better but man the Triumph fits so much better and my middle aged body needs that cruise button!"
65,I only paid 15 grand out the door for mine and I like that on all the rider modes you can customize them and it's not like they give you a million different ways to customize them they give you just enough to make it simple to use and still get what you want out of it plus the fact you can turn traction control wheelie control off and just let that bike go oh man
66,"Its understandable that Supersports are more track oriented and built that way, but why on earth Every motorcycle manufacturers are trying so hard to make their street Nakeds are track focussed as possible..."
67,"It works just as well as the 2017-2019 models, even better... I have the 2020 and my wife has the 2018... The one area where they completely dropped the ball, is the new dash layouts... The new screens are horrible. Pretty to look at when it is parked, but horrible and largely unusable when riding. Whatever graphic artist they assigned to that project, has clearly never ridden a bike..."
68,Saw one yesterday ‚ù§Ô∏è That silver paint pops in the sunshine
69,The best video of this amazing bike. I got this baby and I have been giggling like a school girl YEEHAA!!!
70,"2020 has the same power as the previous one, but 9% more torque."
71,I have a 2012 R. Don‚Äôt want no fancy electronics.
72,I love the Street Triple. It is avesome. ... But the KTM Duke 890R is more fun.
73,Mirrors are triggering me ...
74,"I've got the 2020 Street Triple R, I previously had the 2018 R and after reading reviews of the 2020 RS (improved mid range etc.) I'd decided to go for it pending a days test ride. after the test I was ready to hand over the cash, Triumph really had improved the mid range to the point that was now on par with the 2018 R but still with that very top of the rev band rush over the R but before I'd completed the deal the dealer asked if I'd tested the new R yet ,which I hadn't, thankfully I took the opportunity to test the R as it's also been upgraded, the first thing you notice is that first and second gear have been shortened to improve bottom end (the R was always faster 0 to 60mph than the RS) but it's now to the point were it's obvious, they've also improved mid range, once again giving the R an advantage over the RS, the RS is definitely the bike to go for if you do a lot of track days but for a road bike and every day use the R has it over the RS, the one negative point with the new R is the lack of a TFT which was on the previous model but the new quickshifter/auto blipper more than makes up for it, hopefully next years R will have the lovely TFT off the Trident .I added bar end mirrors and a seat cowl to my new R which IMO improves its looks and functionality."
75,"I've ridden both this one and the 2018 version. And while they may not be my favourite visually. I really am not a fan of the headlights. The way they ride.. man, sound great, handling is great, comfort is great, this bike has everything. Gives a lot of confidence. Only reason i haven't bought one yet is because there's bikes that are better looking to me. But the street triple RS is a dream while on it."
76,I have a trident and thinking of upgrading to the r or rs. Most probably the r since I don‚Äôt do track days or ride too much on a highway. Only thing on the r that‚Äôs outdated is the dash. I love a simple dash but this is just old. 
77,I really have a problem with the front optics of this motorcycle! but the rest it is true that it is a beautiful motorcycle!
78,Hello hello nice video but I find that it is small for a large size (1m80) compared to the z900 which looks more imposing to me I really have trouble on this vision
79,I have the street rs 2021 it's a treat in terms of chassis accel braking shifter I find that it is super well equipped hence the price ... and in terms of design it's aggressive I find
80,"u I have the R 2022 a madness no need more, the engine character and the chassis are just huge ;)"
81,765rs vs 890r which one do you take in the end if you are given one? For my part (Hendi) the duke without hesitation
82,Nice bike but I really have trouble with the optics and above all it's banging on degraded roads and it skips
83,I have the 2020 model and there is security even with the tcs off Ducoup the weeling is a bit complicated it cuts the gas automatically..
84,"Street triple RS or Duke R 890? And why ? It's a very difficult choice, but I would say the 890. Complicated to explain everything in writing but its engine and the general character of the bike"
85,"I have just spent (2 months) from a CP3 SP to this Street and I totally agree with you except on the comfort... (actually it absorbs small bumps better than MT, but on the other hand on the bumps, be careful it hits in support, beware of ""kidney strokes""!). For the rev counter, have a screen with a large display... Top test bravo. üëç‚úåÔ∏èüòâ I won't come back to the MT even for the engine, actually maybe more fun at low speed..."
86,'ve had this bike for eight months and after 22 years of not riding it really is the best bike I've ever bought.
87,It's a motorcycle that I found ugly. I went to try it on and bought it üòÖ She's awesome.
88,"small precision, the matte gray is on the Street Triple R. For the RS, it goes in gray / shiny silver and it's beautiful."
89,"I tried this bike two weeks ago at Triumph Ambutrix and I had the same opinion as you, on the suspensions I felt like I was on a magic carpet on the road so much it filters the imperfections in the bitumen, the 3-cylinder still works in the revs and gives the impression of being like a 4-cylinder, so a little disappointed... I had everything original on it and the saddle was already super comfortable, engine noise super original exhaust and airbox, and the shifter is cool even if I shift gears quite high to the shifter below I find that it is not good for the gearbox and when descending I prefer use the clutch to control the release of torque. Afterwards I had my feet on the ground for 1m72 and super light for parking maneuvers at the same time I ride a Shiver 900 so everything I try seems light and low saddle üòÅ I would say that the Yamaha engine on the chassis of the Triumph it is ideal, I find that it lacks sensations at legal speed."
90,It's a bike that has often tempted me (R version because it's more punchy) but 2 things are preventing me from taking the leap: - I still can't get used to the front end (need the face of the trident ^ ^). - the welds on the front of the frame are too visible (triumph has gotten us too used to top finishes and for me it's a little missed).
91,The sound is very nice of this 3
92,"have had a Street Triple RS from 2019, it's true that with the position on the front and this 4-cylinder character, it gives too much confidence and you want to fool around with it by exceeding your limits ^ ^ I had an MT-09 before the Street, clearly the Street is superior but finally, the Street is so efficient that in sustained rolling, it is less forgiving of trajectory errors than the MT. And besides, I'm thinking of taking the new Ducati Monster which seems to be a good compromise between the MT-09 and the Street ;) V"
93,I own the 2019 R and I have the impression that the engine of my R is more punchy at low revs than this RS (I have the arrow pot) very pleasant motorcycle to ride you can walk around or shoot stuffing
94,it is not the R that exists in a lowered version? The RS is announced at a seat height of 825 mm. I'm small too
95,"This was also my opinion after the test with Fabike. The best, really."
96,This cable that passes almost in front of the screen... it's a shame!
97,The sound of this bike is terrible
98,"so what did you think of it compared to its big sister speed?‚úåÔ∏è More playful, but less practical for cool riding (torque"
99,so XSR or street? ;) If it's the same price it's hard to choose
100,it is still too smal ? the street is a little yes 1.85 m 
101,the best not quite since the duke 890R came out
102,I admit that from the side it's weird
103,Really average screen!
104,"I don't find the mask ugly at all. This gives the bike something special and sets it apart from the other 0815 bikes. The engine sound is also unique. I had a Kawa z750r before my Speedy ne and the bike was just plain boring. The Speedy with its 3z is much more fun and you don't get the feeling of riding a mainstream bike. Take a look at the Streety or Speedy in real life and test drive them, you'll be amazed right away. Thanks for the test"
105,"Hello, nice bike and to be honest, I find almost 12000 for sone well made, well equipped and I think the service intervals are not that much, even humanely. But you have to have them first!"
106,"Such an ingenious part... if only it weren't for the durability and Triumph weren't currently developing a hell of a Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple that would optically be a case for my top 5 and which I would actually buy like that üòç Actually, the street would love it , but somehow the engine rocking the competition to the ground seems over-engineered. The engine runs better than some 1000s üòÖ "
107,"Unfortunately, the engine damage during the motorcycle endurance test has reduced my confidence in the Street Triple. It's noticeable that with 2 machines at about 30k km the engines break down"
108,Just did a test drive with the machine yesterday. Can I confirm everything that you have stated and said here. A real fun machine!!!
109,"the brake lever or Brembo MCS brake pump, the little wheel you show is not for adjusting the width of the brake lever (this can be seen further to the left), but for adjusting the pressure point of the brake (19, 20 or 21) - almost how snappy they are Brake reacts to 1mm lever travel. Very cool feature, already tested it myself, and unfortunately the Triple R no longer has this brake pump in MY 2020."
110,"Unfortunately, I didn't find them that cool, even after an extensive test drive on the RS. Looks great, the first Streety that I actually like. Engine, sound great, but I found the draft almost boringly neutral. The world blurs incredibly fast, but also quite ""subtle"". I found the speedometer terrible in terms of readability, not to mention the rev counter. Ergonomics of the controls wasn't really mine either. Should I reach for the turn signal, I was stuck on the Jobdial and vice versa. Mirrors are great, but should also be a little further away from the handle, as it can lead to annoying pressure points on the hand, E-Gas should also be a little more controllable in the low-load range, but otherwise all in all a great machine... Mine works anyway tendency (coming from a 600cc super sports bike)"
111,"the motorcycle test there have been serious doubts about the durability. There has probably never been a double total loss in the motorcycle endurance test history. The statement by the Triumph engineers, who said after the first total failure: It is probably an isolated case, is also put into perspective. Thank goodness at least the drivers survived.Personally, I would rather go for the Kawasaki Z900 because it's 2000 euros cheaper and it just looks better in terms of opticsüëç"
112,"I think the Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple is great, but the lights in front üò¨ Exactly, you want to take your head off.....üôà"
113,I think Triumph should have laid the clutch cable in such a way that the view on the display is really clear üí™üí™ otherwise I think the bike is great ü§ó
114,"Personally, I would rather go for the Kawasaki Z900 because it's 2000 euros cheaper and it just looks better in terms of opticsüëç"
115,I've sat on it before and you can see it here in the test. The clutch cable is in the middle of the field of view of the display. I have no idea who designed it that way and why...
116,This lamp mask is so unspeakably ugly. That hurts
117,So the headlights ........ my face are ugly. If you look at the bike from the side you really get the puke and laugh from the front. How can you design something like that?
118,".After reading that the 2020 RS had a better low and mid range I considered changing my 2018 R to the RS but after testing both the RS and R back to back I found that the R is still a better road bike with more comfortable suspension and still better acceleration, the RS has it at the very top end but how often do we get there apart from the track? I miss my 2018 Rs TFT but the quickshifter/auto blipper more than compensates for this so I'm extremely happy with my new 2020 R!"
119,KTM's may come and but the triumphs are here for ever. Especially the triple.....literally took me to my wit's end. Such a powerful yet well mannered machine.
120,"Ground clearance is 165mm. That is my dream bike. More power, good ground clearance, lower seat height option. This is a dream bike for shorter riders."
121,"Mad mad machine, absolute monster it is!"
122,My dream bike as of current standards‚ù§Ô∏è. Currently i have pulsar 180 Will be buying ktm390. After that its all street triple
123,New value king in the India middle weight ! Well done Triumph!
124,"I still ride the old Z800 while my brother had this exact new Speed Triple R. I am 5'10 and my Z feels heavy in traffic and low speed corners but this bike is pure madness. Its lightweight compared to my z800, it feels more like riding a Ktm duke390 on steroids, but one thing i dont like is the ground clearance which almost scrape every speed bumps."
125,"Was waiting for the Autocar Verdict.Great Bike, my only issue is luggage carrying ability while touring, can the rear seat hold a Rynox or Dirtsack touring setup? Shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I‚Äôve toured on a Street Triple with luggage"
126,"Yes the new triumph street triple r is a fantastic middle weight bike .it looks very cool and sporty,  the 765 cc engine is smooth & refined, the built quality is impressive, and that 3 cylinder sounds superb. Their is no doubt that its very capable middle weight bike, it can be used on the city as well as on the  highway and very good bike for the race track to. At rupees 8.84 lacks The new street triple is an all-round package. 
Waiting to see the comparison between this and the KTM 790 DUKE."
127,I like Kawasaki Z900 because it's 84 thousands cheaper than this and it also gets TFT display
128,Only if they had better head for bike Asthetics would on next level
129,Kawasaki z900 is still the vfm king
130,Am I the only one who wants a different headlight?
131,This bike will look ridiculous in 5 years
132,"What about engine heat and hot air thrown on rider by radiator fan?? Definitely present, but not extreme"
133,"I don't understand why people are still buying Z900. This has Brembo radially mounted brakes, Pirelli tires, quick shifter and light weight along with better built quality. All this for a premium of just INR 84 k over Z900. Still a steal!"
134,The headlights looked better before I think... now it looks like a cartoon character from the front üëÄ
135,Plz change the head light.. that mantis eyes light weird
136,Ugly headlights
137,9 lakh bike and still have analog dials
138,"This looks like the worst bike I have ever seen, I wanna know why people are crazy about it? Can anyone enlighten me?"
139,"As owner: Pro: - driving position: the front end feels good even though it does not have a loaded position like a super sports car, you don't get tired even after 400-450 km laps (a minimum of pain in the legs because they feel slightly too much folded, I'm 1.80 tall). - powerful and modular braking, it could be even better if the radial pump remained instead of the axial nissin, very good braided hoses (jap take a cue) - engine: wonderful delivery (at any speed and in any gear you don't feel the need to downshift), nice sound to be euro5, in the mountains with third gear you do what you want (from 3000 to 12000 rpm the engine always pulls), too bad the excessive on-off on the gas especially in second gear and in the sports map .




- finishes: the bike is really well made to cost 10k, some small imperfections on the control blocks On the handlebar, more than forgivable - gearbox: fast and easy to maneuver, the quickshifter is a wonderful gem in sports driving to eliminate change times gear. -heat: the bike warms up very little if you are dressed in technical clothing (I have no experience with short clothes, if it were up to me I would forbid to ride on two wheels in ""beach"" clothes), only a slight warm-up of the right foot due to the exhaust (probably eliminated with an aftermarket muffler)


-Diablo Rosso 3 original equipment: great folds, excellent wet and wet behavior, good resistance to the motorway, it is not obvious to find such a suitable tire already fitted as original equipment. Cons: - standard rear mono adjustment: probably due to my weight (80 kg dressed) it tends to pump excessively on the undulations of the asphalt, especially in the pronounced folds, excellent move by Triumph to write in the booklet the recommended calibrations on the base the type of use. - autonomy: the combination of a small tank and low fuel consumption will force you to refuel every 200-220 km of happy driving.




- aerodynamic protection: this is to be expected from a naked, forget long motorway sections at over 110 km / h, the aftermarket fairings do not improve much if you are tall. In general I recommend this bike, I do not find the RS 2020/21 version very sensible for the following reasons: - I don't see the 2000 euro justified: the showa fork of the RS is scarce like that of the R, the 5 HP of the engine are only mapping . With that money difference we get radial pump, mono, front forks and map of much higher quality. -TFT display: the tachometer of the RS is something ridiculous to the nth level, totally illegible"
140,Simply the best sporty medium naked
141,I'd take it just for that gear. Too bad about the swingarm. I miss the single arm of the old speed
142,A round of applause to Triumph for the counter-current choice of the dashboard. I love the needle tachometer 
143,"Am I the only one who prefers the analog tachometer?  ; no I like it better too! and I'm 21 ; No, tachometers should always be analog, like nice watches, they are always analog. Not for nothing the new 992 GT3 has the tachometer ..... analog!"
144,"The biggest flaw of these bikes always remains the price. That's too much money, in general with half the price or a little more you can take home a speed of 7/8 years ago. Same goes for the other mid-range."
145,Of course Euro5 kills the sound
146,Perhaps the best average naked on the market
147,"They should put all the saddles at 79.5cm at least for the naked, so even the dwarves like 1.60mt have more choice"
148,It is small so much so that in Germany they go tt of kawa z900
149,Enviable price quality
150,"Analog tachometer beats those tft abortions 3-0, if it's a step backwards for you you better go do phone reviews with galeazzi"
151,"I test rode one a few weeks back, I loved it, so smooooth and probs just right sort of speed for the roads."
152,"Good review. I'll stick with my old 675 for now, but good to see all of the latest improvements."
153,"This bike has all the big-bike electronics for middleweight money. Value for money,yes it is."
154,"I bought this model in the Matt black and the bike doesn‚Äôt disappoint üëå recommend anyone to test it , best value for money for the gear and performs as good as if not better than any middleweight"
155,"Also, if you went with a 2020 or new R model instead of the RS, you can easily unlock the top end power with an Android phone, the TuneECU app and a bluetooth adapter. They stopped using different cams and tunes between the two models starting in 2020. The motor, cam, fuel and ignition maps are identical between the R and RS. It's the same motor. All Triumph did was tell the throttle by wire tables, that if you twist the throttle to 100%, the ECU will only deliver 100% power on the R up to 7000rpm, and then it backs it down to 80%... Twist it as hard as you want, the ECU will only deliver 80% power past 7k on the tach. Luckily, you can edit those tables on TuneECU and tell it to deliver full power all the way to redline, in about 15 minutes. Very easy to do."
156,"I thought you where testing the Speedy when I clicked on this. I don't think the 765 is made for my 6'2"" frame"
157,"Triumph is continuing to under report the power output. Most stock RS's are getting anywhere from 116-119hp at the wheel, stock. Assuming a standard 15% drivetrain loss, that means the crank HP is in the 135-138hp range. I know that when it first came out, they pitched lower power than it actually made, because they didn't want it cutting too deeply into the larger Speed Triple 1050 sales... But now that they have the 1200 out, they can be honest about what this bike makes, no? With a slipon, decat and tune, I am getting 125hp at the wheel out of mine, which translates to a crank HP of 140+... I know folks getting even more with full systems... but like I said, stock bikes are getting at the wheel, almost what Triumph is claiming at the crank."
158,"By all accounts this is a great bike for the money, The KTM is cheap n chintzy!! and ready to explode at top-end with a boomerang exhaust and a Lady-bum head light !!. The Mt-09 is bags of fun but has had early rust issues.!! The Street sound 100x better than the above with a slightly sporting feel. Great tool if you don't mind the pair of Bol*cks for head lights grafted on as an after thought ?? Humm choices choices ? "" Test ride guys and follow your heart "" üíì"
159,Great bike but this price range i would rather go for gsx s1000
160,"I got the R model, perfect for the road, suspension is less crashy"
161,"I‚Äôve had one of these since January and love it. To pick up on a few things on the video, I‚Äôve wound the suspension into comfort mode which helps a bit with no real downside for normal riding. I also ride with it permanently in road mode. On longer rides the only comfort issue I have is with my backside starting to go a bit numb, but I get that on most bikes. Overall this summer has been a lot of fun on it and I‚Äôm really happy with my choice"
162,"Still loving my RS, enjoying it as much as possible üëç Good review,Dan ü§ô PS: the fueltank can only hold 14 litres , it says 17 litres on every spec sheet but it just doesn‚Äôt üòè I‚Äôm doing 200km with one tank...at 6,50 litres/100km, that makes only 13 litres actually (reserve 1 litre?) . Sadly ..."
163,"Same thing with my triple R, only 14l. I have tried to keep riding after the reserve light is on until the display indicates almost 0km left stopped for fuell. There was still a decent amount of fuell in it, could not get 17l in it. Now i know i don‚Äôt need to stop asap for fuell, i just watch the indicator for "
164,Loved the intro buddy! That headlight is amazing on this ... these always look better in person than the videos
165,"Looks like the complete package, sounds gorgeous but that headlight I'm not sure I could live with."
166,"The sound of the engine is georgous. I'm looking at selling my 2021 Ninja 650 next spring and the street triple is a defo contender to replace it. Only really wanted the ""R"" version, but I love the black and yellow option you get with the ""RS"" version. Going to my local dealer in a couple of weeks to look at the bike in the flesh. As always, thanks for the great review Dan... I might be sold fella..."
167,"Hello, EBD. Great review as usual. Great bike as well. One criticism and one question: - the mount for your handlebar gopro is substandard (understatement); the footage is, at times, way too shaky and I found myself listening to rather than looking at some footage - what is the brand/model of your lid? Cheers."
168,"To me, this bike looks great. Looks modern and very sporty. Very good."
169,"I have the exact same bike, and I am loving the looks. Traded in a 2017 Street Triple R(shiny black) model which was also very nice, but the new one, especially in that color just grabbed me. The additional performance was just a bonus. The only complaint is the dash layout, which was MUCH better on the older model."
170,I owned an earlier version of the 765 street and agree completely with your assessment of this one. I also owned a '15 street 675 and though I liked its motor better the 765 handles way better than the 675 did - for me - and the brakes on the 765 are great. My 765 was the RS version and its power didn't kick in until at least 8k rpm so I would recommend the R model since its torque comes in earlier (i'm told).
171,I love this bike. Just had test ride and bought it on the spot. Been riding bikes for over 20 years and can‚Äôt think of a better bike for the road. But be careful going for a test ride.... it might be expensive!
172,hands down one of the best road bikes money can buy. Hope to buy it one day
173,"I love the looks of this bike, rides very good. No problem with my 6'3 length also"
174,The headlights have grown on me ; now I like them. Engine sounds incredible . Love the KTM 890 too but don‚Äôt you think it would be less reliable ? Especially in the heat . I use my one bike to commute year round in British weather .
175,"I love the look of the street triple. It is unique. All other motorcycles look the same, especially the supersports ..."
176,"I think it‚Äôs a decent looking bike but I‚Äôd get the R. Regarding the headlights , nothing beats the gen 1 dual round headlights üòé"
177,"I think it looks great, mid range punch is what this bike needed and that's what it has now and it's still only 165ish dry."
178,That old school double headlight that the earlier Speed Triples came with were classic. I wish Triumph would bring those back.
179,"I don't understand people who think it looks hideous. I think it has great proportions, and the headlight makes it looks unique."
180,"Gotta agree with the looks, the body and tail looks great but the front not so much. I've never really like the look of the front which was why I've always preferred the Daytona 675"
181,"I bought a 2020 Triumph Street Triple about five months ago and love it. I have the silver one and I think they look very sharp. The bike is so silky smooth and you can tell it's a quality built machine. The handling is amazing and it feels so light and nimble. And it's quick. Love the sound of the 765 triple. I will preface this by saying I sold a 2019 790 Duke to get this bike and there is no comparison. That bike was tractor like - very clunky quick shifter and it had jerky fueling. It did handle well, but the Triumph feels more refined and smooth as far as the engine and quick shifter. I put this bike up there with the 2018 BMW S1000 R that I have as far as quality, smoothness and handling. But the Triumph is more comfortable - feels smaller, which it is, and less of a reach to the bars."
182,"I have only 2500 miles on my 18 but I totally disagree about the traction control. I hual ass and have perfectly worn the tread from center to outside edge where the diablo logos are (basically a dot slick) and the Periili Diablo Super Corsa grip from 40 degrees on a sunny day to shred the little specs on the track in the summer. I have a Yoshimura header back pipe that drops 10 pounds easy and is crazy loud without the insert but just right with it installed and you can still hear the incredible intake howl! But there is no need for a fancy IMU traction control on a bike with 120 something HP and 60 lbs of torque and track tires. Set tc to the lightest setting you barlely notice intervention and barley see the light flash on the gauges even on a corner leaned over full throttle exit. I think this dude does smoke before hitting the track! This bike is like a scalple! It goes where you think and has enough power to do an 11 second quarter and keep up with much higher displacement bikes with good riders. I have tried to own bikes that do many things ok like a Ninja 1000SX or Ninja 650 but this bike has made me a better rider and is one of the best bikes for the money or not period. However, what he said about the M50 Brembos is true including the MCS adjustability. They stop so well that you have to be careful when you ride other bikes and alllow for extra distance comparatively. You can get heated grips that are so sweet they display hi/lo in the gauges and have no noticeable wires conneccted to the throttle that rotate with it."
183,"I really appreciate this engine, very smooth and lots of torque. You can feel the quality construction of the bike, everything is good quality and besides all this the triples are record breaking in Moto2. So... I dont really understand how, regardless price, you can put the BMW above the triple. Be honest, you would love to hate the Triumph but then you feel the pleasure of riding it. Its obvious you dont like it besides all the quality and pleasure it gives. Very strange review. But thank you"
184,
185,"There is something that the Street Triple delivers that I have never felt on another bike. It's blends the perfect combination of speed, agility, nimbleness (is that a word?), and balance. It just FEELS great to ride and it sounds better than any motorcycle I've ever been on. I own a lot of motorcycles and have owned a lot more in the past. The Street Triple is something special. My favorite bike I've ever owned."
186,"The dash isn‚Äôt really that complicated. You‚Äôve got the 4 way thumb control to swap between views and scroll through the menu, a confirmation button, a ride mode button, and a home button. But you didn‚Äôt mention the rev gauge, which is pretty terrible. This was a pretty curiously hot-and-cold review. Like Adam wanted to like it more than he hated it or vice versa. Personally I love the bike after having it for about 6 mo."
187,"Well, I didnt like the plasticy of the Duke (esp. the mountain between your legs), so got the RS"
188,"1. Return to the clear, beautiful dash of 2018 (everyone loved it; why would you change it?) 2. Add cruise control. It's already ride-by-wire. 3. Bring back the interesting color schemes. Why does the RS get boring colors."
189,"I test rode one just for the heck of it, and it rides very well, but I, just like you, also felt that the overall look of the bike is just plain fugly. It's not just the head light seemingly looking out of place to me, it's everything at any angle. It doesn't flow well IMHO. It looks like a bunch of different parts and styles thrown together to make a bike. If you can get past the ugly look i will admit, It is so smooth and comfortable though, but i just can't get past the looks of it. Sorry the styling sucks. Bring on the hate i can take it, for the guys that love this bike. It's just not for me but enjoy what you love and ride safe out there. I'm leaning more towards the Suzuki Gsx S1000 with the return of the 05-08 gixxer engine in it. It's a very good looking bike with a beast of a proven engine in it. I'm ok with that. Cheers."
190,"Adam you called it right it is FUGLY! I enjoy your reviews but please raise the camera angle so we can see the road ahead and not just the handlebar + instruments.My 2019 Yamaha 900GT has cruise control,heated grips,quick-shifter,TFT dash,adjustable windscreen,and easily removable hard bags.All for 12 grand plus tax +tags.I rode and compared a 2019 Triumph RS before my purchase and my decision was easily made.8000miles later i'm still grinning.Keep up the good work!"
191,I like the old school style myself and would bring back the bug eye headlights too.
192,I agree. I never liked the headlamps on a street triple. They always looked like googly eyes - like Forky on two wheels or the head of an insect. Aprilia did a much better job of this on the Tuono.
193,omg i love this.. i got my self a 2020 street triple rs in silver ice clolour and i love every second i spent on it.. it feels a lot more premium than other naked üòé
194,"Love Triumph having owned a Speed and Tiger but both had recurring issues which to me is not acceptable. Seems the test bike here had a fault with the high beam headlight and squealing front brakes. Wow the RS is $3k more than the BMW F900! I know you get Brembo brakes, Ohlins suspension and a triple engine but maybe you should compare the base model or R with the BMW?"
195,"I agree, it should have cruise control and heated grips!! I'm pretty sure the Triumph Tiger 800 and 1050 both have heated grips and cruise control as options and possibly similar electronics so it baffles me why they wouldn't include it on they're other bikes if they are sharing parts. Its a 13k bike OTD COME ON TRIUMPH~!!"
196,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong iam a great fan of the Triumph triple, and I ride a 675 myself. That‚Äôs why i felt really sorry for Triumph as i got to read in a german magazine a about a series of engine damages in their long term tests. They tried to rum this bikes predecessor the 2017-19 model in their 50000 km long term test, the first bike made till 20000km and the second one till 29000km. Both were stopped by torn off intake valves. Until today Triumph wasn‚Äôt able to find the reason for those faults. Well i know it‚Äôs German but here‚Äôs the report anyway: https://www.motorradonline.de/naked-bike/triumph-street-triple-rs-50000-km-dauertest/"
197,"What are you guys talking about, it looks awesome!"
198,More sporty then the duke 890
199,I saw someone do a headlight conversion where they replaced the originals with a big round single headlight and it looks sooooo sexy
200,"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô1‚Äù, 240, and have a great time hooning on my son‚Äôs ‚Äò20 STR... I may have to get one for myself.."
201,Other than the headlights I like everything. Bug eyes design was only cool on Benelli 899 etc.
202,"i like where you focus on the point where people leave out in their videos, comparing today¬¥s standards next to other brands offers, thats very important bcs most of the ppl like me come here and hear these opinions before trying and purchasing it. besides all technical aspects, i never liked the headlights of the previous models however they made the new ones more aggressive look with led eyebrow, looks very good in my opinion. Rest of the design its not very interesting to be honest."
203,"Have to disagree with you about the lack of IMU... it‚Äôs a street bike, it‚Äôs not a sports bike. People complain that bikes are already too expensive and then also complain that they don‚Äôt have all of the gizmos found on bikes that cost $20,000. Triumph made sensible compromises with this bike, heated grips are available and aren‚Äôt unreasonably priced for those of us who need them and those who don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt paying for an extra they don‚Äôt need"
204,I love the blunt honesty about the Street Triple getting left behind by the latest crop of middleweights such as the KTM 890 Duke R.
205,"Triumphs always looks premium compared to other naked bikes,"
206,This bike feels High Quality and built to last. The duke feels cheap and plasticy. Triumph anyday....
207,Who had their rear seat included? I had to buy mine and the grab bars. And Triumph's website sucks to find the correct part numbers. Even the dealership has a difficult time finding the correct part numbers. And after market stuff is hard to find too... I would like a little more comfortable seat that is not angled toward the tank more perpendicular.
208,That headlight is HIDEOUS...cant get pass that.. I can live with suzukis gsxr headlight but this is a NO GO
209,The new headlights look so good!
210,"The headlights on this bike have always been hideous, however the rest of the bike has never looked better. Triumph really ought to put a round headlight on this bike, looks brilliant with an aftermarket one."
211,Nice bike with the ugliest headlight assembly in the motorcycle industry. There is just no way to like the thing sticking off the front of the bike like that.
212,"Watching this review of the Triumph street triple RS has made it an easy choice of not buying this bike. Seems like a good bike but i'm not looking for good, I'm looking for great"
213,"I don't like it. Looks like the old model, heavy, And 2018 ABS fail in many bikes. I prefer MV Agusta Brutale 800"
214,They need to pull the headlights closer to the handlebars. Love under engine exhausts. Mufflers are ugly especially when stuck on the side of a bike. Great review! Thanks
215,"Ugly?? Ugly!??! How dare you! Seriously though, Adam kept saying that like it's not subjective or debatable. I find this motorcycle to be gorgeous, even the front ""appendage"" and I know a lot of people who do as well. In fact, I had no idea it was even considered ugly or a bad design by some. I did hear a lot about the last generation's headlight shape but everyone seems happy with these new hornet looking ones. I don't know Adam, I for one, hope they don't change this bike too much. It looks about as good as a bike could look already!"
216,Only 55 HP in Aus but why? Till 6k?
217,"I‚Äôve got a Trident. Up to 800kms. V happy with it, looking forward to getting some real oil in it and being able to wind it up"
218,I would like to know about the passages seat. Is there enough room for a passenger or is it too short? Yeah definitely could take someone on it.  Probably not for long distance but would work
219,Got mine last week. Funnily enough my left hand mirror was also loose and needed tightening
220,Ah finally the colour I want.
221,Would you recommend this one or svartpilen 401 for a beginner ? Definitely this over the 401
222,Just sounds the same Just it is very similar to the 660S street triple we have in Australia
223,"A very beautiful bike!!! ‚ù§üá¨üáß‚ù§ Triumph was able to combine retro style, modernity, class, sobriety, ease, technology at a rather ""reasonable"" price....."
224,"This is a bike that will sell well for sure! üòâ We're a little tired of seeing the Yam on every street corner, that will change but I hope it will be as fun in weeling. An important point that you didn't talk about is also its advantage in terms of maintenance with revisions every 16,000 km. This is important for those who have servicing done at the dealership."
225,"Superb video, a bit thanks to Maya too must be said! ;-) The bike is very successful, it does not break with the quality and seriousness of Triumph. Clearly it's going to get a nice little place in the sales of A2 motorcycles and I'm also waiting for the release and testing of the future Aprilia Tuono 660 which certainly won't have the same price but which I also find very attractive."
226,This Trident will turn the market around!
227,"this Trident looks quite attractive, let's hope that the reliability is there, because it catches my eye."
228,"Can't wait to try this. She looks very nice to me this new little Triumph and this for a relatively low price. Thank you Triumph for continuing to offer us cool motorcycles in this world where thermal motor vehicles are increasingly singled out . üëç And thank you motorlive, for giving us a bit of ‚òÄÔ∏è with this beautiful video üòâ"
229,A real little beauty ü§© She will take market share for sure üòâ Have a nice day ‚úå
230,Triumph is on track to hit the mark because this bike really has a nice face
231,"Very nice bike, it smells of cardboard for Triumph. The style is perfectly balanced between neo and retro, and the 3-cylinder still a great engine. Nice test Maya, thank you"
232,"Top test, especially to have left time to hear the engine. Really nice the look of the bike, it looks like my r1200r, back in curves."
233,Beautiful motorcycle!
234,"She looks very good this little bike, it would be worth a try :)"
235,"Beautiful presentationüëçüëç. Beautiful bike but still a problem with the exaggerated whistle of the 3 cylinders, you can hear it clearly in the video. But she has her place in this segment.üëçüëç."
236,"A great success, congratulations Triumph"
237,Very nice little motorcycle that will surely be a hit with young bikers and especially for female bikers. I hope that the small trail with the same engine will not take too long to arrive.
238,"ery nice motorcycle! And an affordable price, well seen. On the other hand, it really does not address the same clientele as the MT07, which in my opinion is more masculine and younger."
239,"Thanks for this test! I have a real crush since I discovered it. Me, who doesn't usually like roadsters... I'll go and try it in France on vacation at the beginning of spring!"
240,"She is top this Trident! Even if, for my part, it will be the Ducati Supersport on which I set my sights "
241,"Personally, I find it magnificent, this retro-roadster mix is ‚Äã‚Äãma-gni-fic!! and the three-cylinder engine in the air at the rendezvous!! crispy ! thank you for your excellent tests!"
242,Congratulations again to Triumph for succeeding in bringing out a great motorcycle for less than 8000 balls üëç I'll be in A2 I'll go straight to order it üòâ
243,I'm not very roadster but it is really beautiful.
244,"Strange to completely forget the SV650 when talking about the competitors, it may not be very young but personally I think it's a great bike, so much so that I bought it elsewhere"
245,"Aesthetically in any case it is successful, it combines sportiness with very British class."
246,"nice motorcycle. On the other hand, the exhaust manifolds quickly seem to color (dirty), I hope it goes away"
247,Very promising bike! I just find the counter a bit ugly
248,"Nice little Trident. I'm curious to turn around to see if the finish is worthy of Triumph. If so, having a 3-legged, properly equipped, with a cycle part less sausage than its Japanese rival MT07, and a contained price (we also add a reassuring design and not manga), it can grab a lot of market share. There remains against it the representativeness of the brand which is not deployed enough, the pans of unreliability compared to a Jap (a prioris die hard), and surely a lack of fun with respect to the engine anyway enjoyment of the MT07. She has a challenge to take up.üëç"
249,She has something (too) sober. Lack of character and identity but for sure it will have a lot of customers because the value for money is excellent üëå
250,"Owner of a 92 trident, I am thrilled with this modern version but not too much We cannot deny the progress of technology even if sometimes I regret the excesses (why so much plastic?) To try .... ."
251,"Finally, for me the real competitor of the cbr650r. A real chassis."
252,"too goodnnnnnnnn üòç I love this bike I've been waiting for since its launch, can't wait to try it in design üòçüòçüòç. And yes she will dethrone the mt07"
253,beautiful all these black pipes clearly visible. Especially on the left with the indications in white. Great !
254,"It sends dreams, and the music is top notch üòéü§ò"
255,"Since 2014, it's the Bonneville SE that supports all my whims very well. But there, the Trident, a second motorcycle, why not."
256,"It's kinda a perfect first big bike for introverts. You know you ride something cool, but you don't always want to the centre of attraction. Understated. Sure. Reliable."
257,"totally agree, its like being the big daddy hunter under the sheep skin, the growl would certainly make it up anyways when you give it a gas....."
258,"""Very quickly, you'll outgrow this.."" Was expecting Shumi will say this for sure. Looks more like a Svartpilen 401 than a triple cyl middleweight from Triumph"
259,"Finally... The review I have been waiting for. Honestly I would like to have a big engine in a compact sized motorcycle which is easy to ride and control. And Yes, Trident it is."
260,"As an owner of Z650, I will say compact is better than the odd bulk which needs to be carried around the corner + extra ground clearance it offers"
261,Triumph bikes are so good only to be let down by their after sales service. I hope the situation improves with the addition of this bike.
262,Yet another excellent review!! I am also looking for upgarde to middle weight segment. Should I go for trident or should I wait for Benelli 600i bs6? Trident
263,"Love the way this bike looks , hope they make a 900"
264,"Looks good from some angles.. asymmetric rear design is not to my taste however, at this price point seems to be a good offering. "
265,Thats a pretty damn good looking swing arm!
266,"Great review in pointing out the flaws in our Indian context. Is it really practical for India where maintaining even 100kph is difficult on highways, with people crossing the streets everywhere? On top of that, the roads are bad and ridden with potholes. At least in US roads have 65-75 mph (~100-120kph) speed limits and one can ride for hours in those speeds. Furthermore, this motorcycle is really small and lacks street presence. It is designed keeping the Western novice rider on mind and like you said, it won't feel special if you move up from a Duke 390 to this."
267,I love compact bikes so yes I'm gonna buy it
268,"Definitely not an attraction grabber I think, I had a similar feeling when Honda launched CB 300 R"
269,"Coming from a 250 Duke, I would always prefer a compact big bike than something intimidating.. I love the size of Trident but the pillion seat looks too small to carry someone for anything longer than 30-40 km.. But I haven't yet seen it in flesh so‚Ä¶... ans : It‚Äôs true. Pillion seat is small"
270,I will still recommend the 650 twins for any person upscaling from a ~250cc motorcycle. Triumph still doesn't instill confidence with their after sales support.
271,That tail design though üî•
272,"I just love the way Trident looks, even when none of the individual design elements stand out. I would rather put a wrap around that UK flag design that they have got going on the tank"
273,The thing is the z900 costs 8.16 lakhs so that might take bug part of the sales.
274,Mt07 if launched would give a hefty competition to middleweight segment...thanks shumi üòä
275,"For the Indian roads any smooth and fast bike more than 200cc is enough, if trident is not able to push in some scary way after 7000 rpm people will not find anything new after spending lot of money. It is okay to spend good amount of money for 3 cylinder big engine. But performance does matter. üëç"
276,Pune roads are very patchy.. even smaller bumps can be feeled. We have sudden jerky structures in city. I would go with Z650.
277,"Even after soo many years we want manufacturers to tune ride quality for indian roads, but we‚Äôve given up on getting better roads from the local governments. ü§£"
278,If i can ever afford a costly bike. I would definitely go for Harley Fat Bob. Or Ducati Diavel without any doubt.
279,A budget bike!
280,"For the pricing It's a good triumph but,needs some more aggression."
281,You changed my perspective I was thinking to go with Z900
282,I wish we didn't have to pay a whooping 244% vehicle import tax in nepal. this bike looks so damn good
283,Hands down best looking bike
284,"Got the white version early last year. Front suspension perfect for my weight, so no Ohlins. The rear shock was absolute crap. Was able to modify a Sachs from an Aprilia RSV 4. Works excellent. bike is 425 Lbs with a full tank."
285,"Gorgeous bike! That thing is so satisfying to watch. If its handling is half as good as it looks, then it's a great bike... I really like your reviews, Jinno. greetings from Mexico."
286,The engine is like mt 09 but the style and the cc is for competitive for CB 650... ‚ù§Ô∏è
287,Reminds me of the r9t. Two of my favorite bikes. This is of course cheaper. Love it!
288,I am confused between trident and cb650r. Can you please advise which would be better option? Here in my country cb is massively overpriced but I found it better to ride...
289,"I wish we could buy trident here in northeast india, i am falling in luv with the design of bike ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ i hope that's not that much expensive like super bikes does"
290,I love the grunt of three cylinder. Perfectly balance
291,Best in class ‚ú®
292,"with the quick shifter option, this is golden."
293,love this bike and i want one
294,This is going to be a good bike for riding to cafe‚Äôs on weekends but it will be eaten alive by the KTM 790 Duke. The Nissin Calipers are a bit out of place and the riding position looks very awkward.
295,Great City Bike!
296,love that jet black color Triumph Logo on flat red color would be great Nice Bike!!
297,honestly sounds like a benelli 500cc 2 cyl engine
298,A great British bike.
299,CFMOTO 650 NK & 700 CL-X by far better value for money.
300,"This is good bike but I prefer the Honda CB650r for just P2,000 price difference. And it's 4-cylinder already."
301,"I hope you can compare this to the yamaha mt07. This bike did not came up when im looking for my first bike (MT07 2020) given the price range. From the tech, this should be better even for the mt07 2021."
302,"189kg?? i dont think that's ""really light"""
303,"Cb 650r, Scrambler & the new MT07 are in trouble with this bike"
304,Quality of Triumph Great
305,The best looking 600cc naked bike for sure
306,"i think the honda cb650r looks better. the trident front end looks incomplete, the dash looks like an after thought, headlight sticks out too much and it would look neater without that swingarm mounted fender"
307,Nice bike. Honest price for what it offers. The entry level mile. The only thing I can't digest is the license plate ... where it is. Can one be mounted where the license plate holders would go?
308,"Hello, I wanted to ask you a few questions: when I tried the bike last winter I noticed that when the throttle is opened there is a certain delay it is not immediate then I wanted to know if the engine warms up and if there are vibrations on the tank handlebar saddle footpegs thanks üòä
Look, I also answer you as an owner in the meantime, since I read, the delay initially bothered me too who was used to enduro, but you get used to it very quickly, and it is annoying only at the start in the end, vibrations there are at high revs, let's say you feel from 8,000 upwards a little more, they don't bother me too much personally. Finally, the engine warms up but not too much, in city traffic you can certainly hear it more, clearly it is a fairly subjective figure as well as the previous ones so nothing to be taken as an absolute fact."
309,"Hello, regarding the error message given by the quick shifter, it appears only if the engine has been turned off with the kill switch (red button). If it is switched off with the key üîë it will not reappear when starting."
310,"This little bike with electronic gearbox, exhaust and low fold handlebar completely changes its DNA .. I like it so much .. It would have deserved a 95hp engine at the limit of the A2"
311,"Do you feel some delaying response on throtthe control? There some lag on throttle response. Whenever you flip the throttle elbow, the responce of bike is coming later. Acceleration and slowing doesnt matter.."
312,"Even less horsepower would be enough for me (50 was enough for me on the old bike) but the chassis pokes me, do you say it might be suitable or should I orient myself on something else?"
313,"The Trident has no problems in the wet, on the contrary, the confidence it inspires is a plus in unfavorable conditions. As for the tires, in the wet the original equipment Michelins are certainly better than the more sporty Continental ones that I mounted later - Lore"
314,"Bella lore I need some advice. I have had a trident depo for a year now and little motorcycle experience behind me since I'm 19 but I aspire to become a geek like you. It's probably not a question of ‚Äúlimits‚Äù, I don't think I'm able to stress a tire like you do, but honestly, I also don't have a great feeling with michelin, especially this summer when it was hot. Considering that I make a 360-degree use of the bike, obviously avoiding the rain as much as possible, which tire would you recommend, perhaps aspiring to a little more safety at the front without resulting in tires that maybe I am not able to carry or maintain. in temperature
I think any latest generation road sports tire is the best choice for the Trident. I mounted the Continental SoprtAttack 4, but alternatives abound: Pirelli Diablo Rosso IV, Dunlop SportSmart Mk3, Bridgestone S22 ... - Lore"
315,"Lory great video. Speaking of the tires, I was evaluating the ContiSportAttack 4 but your comment on the profile of the front has slowed me down a bit. I would like a quick front that gives agility and speed to fall into corners as I have a ""nice gate"" (Z750 from 2008). In your opinion, which of the recent road sports tires have this characteristic? Michelin Power 5? S22? Or would you recommend the Continental anyway?
To clarify, the Continental is not the fastest of the road sports cars. The Power 5, on the other hand, I did not like that much due to the excessive aggressiveness of the front profile, while the Bridgestone S22 are quite similar to the SportAttack 4. Maybe you could try the Pirelli Rosso IV, which I liked at the front. for their being very fast, but without being excessive ‚úåüèª- Lore"
316,"nice bike ..... good value for money WEIGHT power, ..... a passenger seat a little more habitable ... but I think you enjoy it ..."
317,"I see it as a perhaps more modern copy of the suzuki 650 SV. Perhaps for this reason, I see her out of time, arrived late; the market offers more modern lines (perhaps not pleasant) ... certainly different from those of this Triumph."
318,"Electronic gearbox never worked for me .. Always from the dealer .. I give up other problems, more serious .. Sold out after 6 seeds out of desperation .. Only problems, never had a bike like this .. Ridiculous Triumph Italia assistance .. !! Maybe it was a badly born bike, but I only paid for the consequences .. It was always in the workshop .. No more Triumphs"
319,"I love my trident 660, only problem it turns off when I stop in second gear .... and they don't understand where the problem lies, now I have found a video of an Englishman where he explains that the engine cut the powerüò≠
hello, from what I have read in the various groups it is necessary to make a small update to the control unit to solve this problem."
320,"Hello, I wanted to know if you would recommend it to an 18 year old boy with a reduced a2 thank you if you answer me
Absolutely yes! I have not tried it while weakened, but light and agile as it is, I'm sure she can entertain (and teach) even with 48hp ‚úåüèª-Lore"
321,"Apart from the affordablity, the looks of this bike is what attracts me.The way the muffler blends in the chassis and doesn't block the view of the rear tire is awesome"
322,"exhaust is styled to cover a massive 30 pound black box emissions underneath thats more than a hand thick and goes all the way across the bottom. at this point all is lost, and Im looking at u EU with the ridiculous emission regs now. sure u can get a whole new cat delete system. for now. IC engine will be a memory soon enough. were frogs being boiled slowly but it wont be long now. as for the engine triumph neutered that at the camshaft. I test rode this, power curve drops off like u fell off a cliff. its made more torquey, made to sound good, and look good, but its a gutless wonder above 100. gets there pretty quick an with a good sound, but thats about it, take 10 miles or more to get to 120 which probably its top speed. if yur lucky. and the nannys cut in all the time way too much for me, do u like the throttle cut mid corner,and brakes applied? I dont. i wouldnt buy anything newer than say 2015 nowadays. or get a scooter be more thrilling than this. sad."
323,Triples are great engines. Very similar to V4 with torque and high revving but with a little more character. Not too smooth. Triple way easier to work on vs a V4
324,Superb looking bike and sounds really good even on uTube üòä
325,"When I was a kid I used to like my neighbor‚Äôs Honda NTV 650 Revere, it was in the early 90‚Äôs. This new Triumph kinda sends me that vibe, a good all rounder, urban midsize commuter bike. Nothing special, but good enough to manage your daily chores in style."
326,"with this Triumph Trident 660 and Aprilia RS 660 like new bikes there, i dont know if people who rides casually, need bigger bikes. I think the market for powerful litre class bikes is going to be very down in coming years."
327,The best optional for this bike is by far the awesome quickshifter. None of the rivals offer that.
328,the Trident is a really good-looking bike too; hats off to the styling dept.
329,"It‚Äôs still selling like hotcakes, so I doubt they will mess with it"
330,"I am an experienced rider, and I'm considering this bike. The price is attractive, as is the handling that pretty much all reviewers have praised. This would be my primary motorcycle. Do you see this bike as adverse to putting bags on for everyday use, plainly being useful as a grocery getter, as well as not being unsufferable for occasional solo touring?"
331,I hope they make a street triple that looks more like this. I don't hate how the street triple looks as the bug eyes do grow on you... but I prefer this!
332,"I think it's difficult to argue that Triumph wins the fit and finish game. They have figured out how to mold metal and abs together like fine art, hide cables and hoses (try and find one with the naked eye standing back looking at their bikes) and really just produce a bike that at any price point, you'd be proud to own. Seeing the unveiling of the brand new Speed Triple RS, it's obvious Triumph is out to dominate the market. I would drop the $18,500+ for the newly redesigned Speed Triple before I'd give a penny to any of the Ducati naked's lines. I own a Tuono and I'll admit the most manufacturers in this space have rested on their laurels with their heritage models and not really changed much. Triumph is out there innovating and re-tooling for battle. Well done Triumph."
333,When i want to trade in my 2009 street triple 675 r this would be an option it looks great
334,I love this bike - I might replace my 2018 T120 with it!
335,As a student who doesn‚Äôt have much this is perfect in every way
336,"I don't need this bike (have an older, perfectly good Street Triple). But strangely, I want this bike! A slightly comfier, slightly mellower Street Trip is kind of exactly what I want. Must be getting old..."
337,"Triumph, you have my attention?! This is an AWESOME Motorcycle, Wonder if there will be a Scrambler version? This is gorgeous but agreed it would be wicked in a scrambler option!"
338,the trident is what you get when you order a street triple off wish
339,I would never buy a triumph! The T120 has clearly got a gear box issue which triumph will not admit to! I would buy a Gsxs 750 which is a far better bike!
340,"Yet another British journalist blown away by a Triumph's Britishness. Yawn. I really don't believe that it handles ""head and shoulders better"" than the Honda CB650R. You can't say that without riding both back to back on a track anyways. Also, I guess we're never going to address Triumph's huge reliability issues? Of course it's a nice bike, but calm down, overall, it's definitely not going to destroy its Japanese rivals, not even close."
341,"Exactly, CB650 looks better, sounds better and got more power, it gives you a lot more bang for your buck, Yes trident is nice bike but in the price range CB is a much better option"
342,"I bought the trident. I was looking to move up into my second bike, something a little more modern then my 1983 Honda. I was looking at the popular middleweight naked bikes, XSR700, MT-07, CBR650. The Trident really caught my eye in the aesthetics department and the triple cylinder really is quite friendly in city traffic and really fun and happy when you open up the throttle. That being said, I think I would have been just as happy with any of the bikes in the category. I do think the Triumph beats the competition in the value for money segment. I feel like my hard earned money was well spent, you get alot of bike as well as a complete package with the trident. No buyers remorse here. I am very happy with the Trident and as a newer rider, I would definitely consider another Triumph in the future."
343,Loved the review. Really interested in this bike. I just wish the passenger had a little more room for when my wife comes along.
344,I got ride this back to back with a XSR700 and a SV650. Imo the Trident blows away the competition. The smooth ride by wire throttle combined with the superior handling made me feel a lot more confident on the Trident. It brings a lot to the table at that price point.
345,Such a great price!
346,"I wish more reviewer‚Äòs were talking about the lower triangle. The angles between foot and knee and hip on a bike. Your side shots made you look like you were cramped. What is your opinion? If you're over 6', no motorcycle is gonna be less than cramped."
347,"yeah, probably cool little bike for tiny people. and it's definitely small for Spurge (check the legs positioning when he rides)."
348,They offer a lot for the price except reliability which is what you get from the competitors you mentioned.
349,"I'm a Triumph Fanboy, but a triple 660, nah, one too many cylinders at that cc. Hence the CB in line 4 is not even on my radar. Grunt and torque is what i like, hence an MT/XSR or even the SV would be the bike in this category. What would you buy Spurg if it was your money?"
350,"Inline 3's are torque-y. Not as much as the parallel twins of the MT or the v-twin of the SV, but still has grunt. But it is much, much smoother than those engine. Also, the triples sound amazing."
351,"If it were my money? I'd be looking for a used 2010 Street Triple R. Or, if I had to choose new, I'd probably go with the MT-07. I just fit a bit better on that bike, at least the old one, I've yet to ride the new one. That being said, this engine was the star of the show. This seems to have a wider spread of power than what I remember of the MT-07 or the Z650.... But it's been a while. I need to ride them side by side...."
352,looks like yamaha xsr
353,"Nice bike, but I won't be trading my FZ-07 for one. If I had no bike I might be interested, but for me the biggest problem is dealership location. Nearest dealer is 100 miles away. Also I don't quite see the need for riding modes in a bike like this."
354,80 HP is more than enough!
355,Is the dude really tall? Is the bike a lil small or is it the combination of the two?
356,Why does triumph always hVe bikes that seem short in length? Everyone looks like a giant on it
357,Thats a lot of bike for the price
358,I have a Trident but there's not much room for a luggage rack you can however get a tank bag along with the tail bag for smaller items. This bike isn't really meant for cross country hauls or overnighters unless you want to wear a backpack. When I take mine on trips with the wife where I need luggage for the week I find the bike fits nicely in the back of my pickup truck.
359,Bike looks so tiny.
360,Trying to decide between this bike and a XSR700 ü§î
361,I just cant get past the tank ü§¢
362,I love the tank. Everytime I look at this bike I like it more.
363,It's so small.
364,triumph tried a lil too hard. mt07 is still better on a everyday use.
365,Here in UK this bike is a more expensive then a Suzuki GSX-S750 which will walked all over the Trident. But then is you want a triple not a twin or a straight four then Trident is a way to go.
366,Wow 600cc pocket bike... I love it
367,Shame its so ugly
368,That pipe sounds great.
369,That's super charger sound is fireüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
370,I can literally feel the power of this beast even on my screen. The pull and sound like batpod is amazing.
371,It‚Äôs a great machine! It looks a lot better in person than I thought üëç A bit less weight of it and it would be perfect futuristic
372,"this bike gives me amazing vibes, the supercharger sounds like an ev motor (like the amazing live wire) and then the amazing engine kicks in! best of both worlds ( sound wise) plus schaafs hacker level control!!!!"
373,The B.O.S.S. of motorcycles. That sound!! You can just feel how good the engine is.
374,Wow! That sound. I hope we see more supercharged bikes in the future.
375,"The sound is phenomenal and strange at the same time, I was at a racetrack where a magazine was testing the bike, on the straight this bike sounds like no other. A lot like a hairdryer :)"
376,all hail kawasaki for giving birth to this tool of satisfaction at its finest
377,"I've tried an H2 SX SE, and while I think it's a gorgeous bike, I wasn't that impressed by the performance (though I did love the supercharger whistle). The Z H2, being lighter, is probably quite a bit snappier. I'd love an H2, but living in a country with a 6 month riding season, it's hard to justify the expense."
378,very torquey for an inline 4!
379,"130km/h second gear, omg. My sv650 needs like 4th gear for that same with most cars"
380,"you have to give Kawasaki credit. Even if you don't like their bikes, they definitely offer lots of performance in a way that's not scary or hard to handle. Accessible across their entire lineup"
381,"Stunning bike, but I can't part from the sublime, toxicating, soul moving sound from a Tuono V4ü§©"
382,U can feel the power trough the screen.. What a bike
383,The 900 is 3 times more agile.
384,"After watching this video, my confusion between zh2 and SDK 1290 got cleared out. I gonna buy zh2üëç"
385,Dude the sound of the se is so goddamn good. Imma buy one for sure when i have the money and the A licence üôè
386,Whn it takes off it literally sounds like Jet Engine 
387,Tuono 1100 is better than this
388,such a clean sound. so smooth
389,"I love how Kawasaki knows this type of performance is unnecessary, but builds the bike anyway."
390,"Damn, the supercharger whistles at downshifts are sure addictive"
391,"as someone who owns a se+, i think the z h2 definitely has a bit more of unstable element because I have yet to get my h2 to wheelie in a launch yet. although I haven't turned off a lot of the traction control or launch controls so that should be as expected. from a stop and full bang on the throttle to red line then up shifting from 1st with the quick shifter i still do feel the front wheel wanting to but that software does what it is supposed to. unless you turned off the software then its normal for the wheelie of a z h2 but if you didn't and its still doing it then I guess that kawasaki left it to be a bit wilder for the wild bunch that rides the z h2. nothing wrong with that but its a stability element that doesn't set well with me. either way, I love the constant and smooth power delivery that the super charger gives all of the h2 bikes. i have had the pleasure of only riding a '16 h2 and of course my '19 se+ but I think I would have to get very familiar with the z h2 before I start to do some of the crap I do on mine... still, gotta love the chirp!"
392,The electronics definitely keep the front down. But it gets very light still. I didn't really trust it
393,Love the flutter on the downshifts
394,Would you say that after testing the streetfighter v4 and superduke this still pulls harder? I don't know if it pulls harder but it definitely feels the most impressive
395,"I'm really enjoying those noises it makes on the upshifts and the whistle of the supercharger, if only it wasn't so unpleasing to look at aesthetically (in my opinion)."
396,Sounds so smooth!!!
397,this bike is insane! no matter from what rpm you pull the throttle the power is always there
398,"So, the no.1 most impressive acceleration you've felt is the zh2, and the no.2 slot goes to the rocket 3."
399,the ABS can be a bitch and kick in way too early and harsh
400,"The up shifts don‚Äôt sound as smooth as they should. Downshifts sound buttery though. 

Picking up my 2020 Z H2 tomorrow! ‚Ä¶.yea it is not the fastest quickshifter indeed"
401,"True. I've had this bike for a while, and I have driven big bikes before... but never have I ever fully opened the throttle... just too ""scary"" / ""unnecessary"". Half way with the throttle is already enough for most roads, it's that fast. One time I did do more than half-way, and was almost knocked off the bike because I was surprised with the torque and power it had left. Still, it's very very smooth, I was just a squid when I didn't respect the bike. Just riding normally, it's relaxing, and it doesn't ache every muscle on my body when I ride. Only aches after I ride because of the adventure jacket that I'm wearing, which is heavy, but besides that... it feels and sounds amazing when you ride it."
402,The Streetfighter doesn't really pull down low. The SD is comparable or maybe even stronger. But it's the smoothness of the H2 which makes the acceleration so special
403,it has a beautiful sound
404,This bike looks amazing. I wasn't expecting to feel this excited and happy about its release XD.
405,"That massive muffler is acting like a cat converter, so I‚Äôm guessing a simple slip on is all you need to release that beastly sound"
406,"One of the top selling features of this bike is the sound of the blow-off valve, ooddles of torque and of course Japanese reliability."
407,"I'm both happy and surprised to hear positive things about this bike, it seems to be less gimmicky and more of a mature motorcycle than I expected. It's no panigale in the looks department but it looks better in the video than I previously thought."
408,"Kawasaki H2SX SE+ with a simple slip-on pipe and ECU flash, intake filter, goes from about 169 whp, to 240 whp. No lie. Give the ZH2 the same treatment and you can just forget the MV Agusta or Streetfighter V4 ever coming close."
409,"""A lightweight tuono or super duke"" I love my super duke, but I would never call it either lightweight or track focused.I'm not quite sure what to make of the Z H2 either. It's a cool concept but I don't think I'd use it very often. It's WAY to heavy to be fun on small tracks, too naked for the fast ones, too heavy to be just a fun toy and from the looks also too naked to make it a great tourer."
410,You can tell it's heavy and doesn't handle good just by watching how it goes around the curves.
411,"This is in its own class. Dont think this is a supernaked, looks more like a naked super touring bike. It can not win the naked class, maybe the ducati grabs the win."
412,The green black & gold combo looks amazingly new and different than most of the colors I've seen on these newer bikes. Is that color combination offered from Kawasaki factory?
413,ctually looks good from that 3/4 angle. Not as bulbous and bloated as the front on view. Interesting bike which is pretty much in a class of one since Suzuki stopped making the B-King. Although in terms of Kawasaki's heritage it's more of a successor to the Z1R-TC or Z1300 than the H2.
414,"It doesn't look that great or striking but I would get this bike over KTM that looks like a fat dirt bike, and Ducati that is basically a superbike any day."
415,Would love to ride one but I don't think I ever want to have to look at one.
416,"Can't help but thinking the H2SX which costs the same, is the much better looking bike with a full fairing etc"
417,"Granted its got oomph, but the disappointment hearing its got less power than a normally aspirated zx10. Go figure"
418,"A decent screen might make it a good semi-tourer,tank range allowing which would expand it's customer base somewhat.. Or maybe i'm just a hard up crusty old git that wants too much real world use in these missiles."
419,"If there was a reward for world ugliest exhaust pipe this would win it for sure :) , otherwise the bike looks amazing, hope akra slip on or some other is smaller and looks better"
420,Great bike by the sounds of it. But I couldn‚Äôt look at the bike and love it and that rear can has to go. One for Kermit.
421,I love. This will be my new bike.
422,Now if Kawasaki will just put that same supercharger on there ZX-14R and I would trade my 2018 ZX-14R in.
423,Jesus! Look at that exhaust! üòï
424,Why does it look like that???? Why?!??!! Are the designers at Kawasaki blind? Im so dissapointed.
425,Not only is it hideous looking ... its as heavy as a whale üêã.... street fights are meant to be light n agile .... this naked looks as agile as a cruse ship üö¢ üòÇ it‚Äôs not for me I‚Äôm afraid ... I‚Äôd rather the Aprilia‚Äôs 1100 v4 it‚Äôs a considerable lighter bike ....
426,"It‚Äôs nearly 100 pounds heavier than the Streetfighter, WTF?"
427,Hot .... Just üî•
428,Should of gotten a swingle sided swing arm
429,Wish they had better job on the design
430,Looks like a maxi-touring more than a super naked ...
431,Kilos are NEVER good kilos ! Except in the breasts ...
432,239kg??? You must be joking... It weighs more than my 2016 Multistrada.... (235kg w/ 90% fuel load)
433,Kawasaki styling department still more interested in designing transformers than motorcycles
434,Beautiful bike and truly one of a kind .. It may be too massive but I like it that way! 
435,"Great motorcycle, I love all H2s."
436,"Amazing, breaks all molds, asymmetrical and innovative ... certainly not for a traditionalist but for a personality attracted by innovation and diversity. In addition, the weight is declared in running order unlike many other manufacturers that declare the weight without liquids (full of petrol, brake fluid and lubricants) and battery. In short, those who know the Kawasakis regardless of the logic of belonging and the football fans, knows that they are monstrously exceptional bikes in all, the beauty of the Kawasakis is in the ability of the parent company to mix the different aspects of a bike. However, the company's technological rate is very high, unattainable and unthinkable for other motorcycle manufacturers. Airplanes, trains, ships, aerospace technologies, oil rigs, heavy industry, turbines ..."
437,"But how do you do it, on a bike like this and many others, do not think about providing it with a comfortable saddle ‚ùì Well ... apart from the marble saddle .... WHAT A MOTORCYCLE‚Äº Ô∏è Beautiful! "
438,Nice test ... aesthetically I don't like it but I appreciate it.
439,"It is wonderful I bought one and I can guarantee you that it has an indescribable handling, the weight does not feel it can be thrown down very well and acceleration and braking are like a super sports car. for me it is the top."
440,"I don't like the aesthetics very much, but they can do better maybe put a little something on the z1000.Instead the engine is very nice and in my opinion enjoyable at every gear changeüëç"
441,Uff brutall... It will be my new acquisition...
442,"Truly indecipherable motorcycle, 200 hp 230 kg. marble saddle and price furi scala. Only the engine that seems truly innovative for the compressor is valid, and I should also choose roads with fast curves because they are not very agile. In short, I don't think it will have a great following."
443,Aesthetically it is difficult to find beautiful ... certainly original and undoubtedly courageous. Engineering wisdom cannot be questioned. It is certainly a collector's item due to its exclusivity. A ride to do it very happy to hear how the compressor pulls !!! 
444,Too many horses ... on the battered roads we have ... on the track it's fine ..... anyway a nice monster ... of power ....
445,Mamma mia what a crazy bike!
446,Too bad for the weight ........ very nice bike
447,"Aesthetically (to my taste) ugly, especially at the front even if technically very interesting, it makes me think: are all this technology, high weight and obviously ""leavened"" price worth buying? For me no! Personally, since it is not a track bike, I would have preferred a ""classic"" aspirated engine perhaps raised to 1200/1300 cc with ""similar"" performance but with less complications and a more affordable price"
448,The line is gorgeous
449,"Fantastic bike, a little heavy!"
450,I don't like it and it costs too much to be a naked JAP.
451,Unfortunately in Italy there are no free highways. therefore it is useless here except on the track
452,Aesthetically it is unwatchable
453,"Former owner of Kawasaki z1000 model 2016, very comfortable, does not heat up, perfect gearbox, however that was already a super naked despite having 60hp less. As for the riding, it wasn't a track bike or even hairpin bends, a GS and a rider with a handle are enough to leave you behind in the curves. This zh2 is a bar or starting bike at the toll booth, moreover it is without a market for 18,000 euros no one would take the step, just look at the sales data, it is a flop."
454,"Never liked the verdona, a classic example of the uselessness of many horses mixed with an embarrassing aesthetic. Brembo brakes? Tell Vi√±ales I almost keep my Tokiko Nissin giving theirs. Useless bike"
455,"Well done service, good professionals. Bad, heavy, uncomfortable bike, lost money !!!"
456,"Thinking about upgrading to the ZH2 or the Super Duke from the 790/890 Duke. Leaning toward the ZH2 purely because the closest dealership for KTM is an hour away and it's a hassle to get it serviced but there's a Honda dealership 5 minutes from my house that services Japanese bikes. That and the H2 seems to have lower pegs and being a taller rider, leg room is a godsend."
457,As much as I love the zh2 I would opt for the z900 since I'm a shorter rider
458,"I do love that ZH2. I do wish they'd do a naked with a super charger, and a smaller motor. Seems counter productive, i know. But i honestly believe most want that bike BECAUSE it has a super charger, and fun noises."
459,The fact the H2R exists still fills me with childish glee.
460,"I thought the regular H2 was stupid and pointless, so I got one and it is. But I bloody love it!"
461,"Yes, I‚Äôd love to go to the dealership and pick up a ZH2 and start attempting to kill myself right now but Kawasaki has a long drawn out history of screwing with the colors of their bikes. I‚Äôd like to see how this thing looks in Blue or Red or something normal like that. I don‚Äôt understand the correlation between between adding a blower and not being allowed to add a solid primary colored coat of paint."
462,"been looking at this bike and finally got to ride it today. HOLY SHIT I fell in love and became a giggly little schol girl. Only bikes I have rode ar 2019 suzuki gsxs 750 and wife's kawasaki vulcan s. We started riding last year and put about 18,000km on our bike since. Let's just say that felt like one crazy ride. ü§™"
463,autonomy 150km 
464,I would say 18/20 because the price is too high but otherwise superb machine I would even say rocket
465,Too much electronics for me
466,"at 270km/h but on the road except on the autobahn without limitation, there is no use."
467,For me the most beautiful and delirious roadster of the century ü•∞ (I still wonder how you could dare to deactivate everything on this machine ü§î)
468,must see in time the reliability. A very fragile motorcycle!
469,"The fins are useless, Ducati put them on to look ""pretty"", they said they had no use on the road"
470,"Whether you like Ducati or not, the design of their motorcycles makes everyone agree"
471,"I like to compare Ducati to Ferrari, it's elegant, sporty, with very pure lines that aren't too eye-catching, by far my 2 favorite car/motorcycle brands for these reasons."
472,"Personally I've been on Italian for quite a few years and clearly this Ducati and missed I find, too much to japanize it has lost the soul and the design that made the Ducati, Compared even if it and more design day before I prefer 100 times the Tuono 1100 V4 Aprilia, it also makes you see better on a lot of points, has a much more interesting price because well, it must be said Ducati are cute there but the prices are serious...."
473,"to have had a 1198 and 1199 even if I like the v4 I find them much less beautiful than before, since I am at mv f4 dragster and I expect the superveloce in 1 to 2 weeks which arrives it is really a other world"
474,I admit that the ducatis are the best in terms of aesthetics but this bike is purely a yucky z from kawa
475,It is beautiful but the MV 1000 brutal and for the same price more beautiful and all in carbon
476,"Truly an excellent exclusive motorcycle. I was able to try it yesterday for half a day, the power is incredible üò±, I agree with you on all points despite my low level of biker except on the shifter. In arsouille I prefer the aprilia and triumph shifter than ducati. In cushy mode I much prefer that of triumph and well after that of ktm. Otherwise for the 4 fins I am for but once again I join you for our level of biker it may not be of much use but just for aesthetics it's magic."
477,"Perfect bike in my eyes! 20/20, and with or without a winglet she is magnificent"
478,"At the top of the video, monster bikes in terms of power or style. Too much power for me but they are crazy. For against the autonomy ah it stings a bit much üòÖ you have to choose your route well if you do a raodtrip with üòÜ. In real life apart from that too cool too beautiful and personal I like the little fins on the bike üòÅ See you more ride safe (PS we often meet, black hornet next to the smartphone üòÅ)"
479,"I give it 17. I love it, I'm thinking of changing my MT with the Streetfighter. The only thing I find ugly is the fins on the sides, otherwise I love Another good test. Thank you"
480,"I have this new streetfighter and I can tell you that the fins are used even at low speed. at 80 km/h you place your hands between the two fins, your hand immediately presses against the one below. now is it necessary? , I don't really think ."
481,"I was thinking of taking it when it came out but clearly more than 200hp on the road it's mainly to fatten your insurer, I fell back on the SF 1098s"
482,I am for the small fins on the streetfighter and for me the hypermotard is clearly above otherwise I loved this continuous test like that
483,"Really nice machine. But sincerely I find the bike not so easy, not as precise as the R1M. I find it a shame for a motorcycle with more than 28th with three options. Ducati will remain in its grandeur as a very beautiful machine. Thanks for sharing üëç"
484,"I tried it, it's a monster. But on the other hand, it is easy to drive slowly. (In town, it doesn't knock) what shocked me the most is not the acceleration because with 209hp we expect it. But parcontre front braking ouffff what. I almost ate the handlebars. loool parcontre you have found a rear brake? At Ducati it is a legend. Already on mine there is none üòÅ beautiful motorcycle, but hey it's to no longer have a license. Not to mention the price and taxes. But at this price he could have put the fins in Carbon. Too bad there is not a 150hp version"
485,"Thanks puma. Even before its release it incensed the spirits compared to the 1098 which we already knew and which continues to be high placed. The big difference with this V4 and we can see it is the mechanical extension. V2 1098 breaks in 10K, V4 in 14K. As a result, we see that the reduction of the pistons (4 instead of two big ones) makes it possible to give more power, at higher speeds, with conservation of the foot at the back for the low and middle speeds. Because the V2 1098 also, contrary to what one might think for a bi twin, is explosive at the top. The v4 is more modern, more secure while offering much more. They wanted to do even more than the tuono or the big katoche, it's done. But of the opinion all the same that there, as for the sports ones, it also smells of the swan song. In the sense or what will the next ones do to offer even more? I'm not talking about the moralizing side of the style, what's the point blah blah... everyone is free and we're big kids. I'm talking about the fact that with ecology, downsizing has not affected motorcycles (wink Rocket III) and above all, no hybridization yet. But given how autophobic contexts, to the point of no longer liking modern cars (those that are exciting are impregnable because of the eco-boho malus that targets a minority, but penalizes everyone without changing anything to the global problems of ecologies because laid by ignorant mechanics), we are still spared the bikers because much less numerous. But in the long term honestly, the work of performances will not be able to continue in this way of more hp! the weight ? The safe facility? road comfort? Otherwise, on aesthetics: in short. She rocks; as often with Ducati. And above all, these are designs that last. If we take the 1098, clearly it looks ""old"" compared to the V4, but in good condition it remains sexy. Ditto for the 916, the 1098 sbk, the monster sr4 etc.....Audi must leave them this imprint, because for their cars, they have this annoying habit of commercially killing stylistically, the new model on the old one (example , the 1st a3, the a4, the a5 etc)."
486,It's monstrous this bike not to be given to anyone 
487,Just a monster this ducat ü§§
488,consumption level I expected worse it's about like my z1000. Too bad there are more and more electronics. maybe my next one in a few years :)
489,"For a lambda biker the diff between S and no you will clearly not see it, must not forget that the controlled suspensions are expensive and add potential problems. 3000/4000euros is not bad anyway, because in the standard version it is the same price as its competitors (tuono, sdk) and next to come (s1000r, speed). The 20k bar is complicated for many bikers. Cool your video but the wheels every 2 minutes... we didn't even see a real accel because you deactivated all the aids."
490,"a 14/20 not a fan of the front look or the sound or the driving position. For this price there are several other motorcycles that I will take instead. Besides, I thank Ducati for their welcome to Valletta, they are really great"
491,Maybe nothing to do but it seemed to me that fins like that were prohibited on cars because they were too dangerous if you knocked over a pedestrian? Otherwise I love it
492,The fins are used at high speeds to press the front of the bike to the ground (above 260kmh) Ducati had to add them because otherwise the front would rise and it would not pass the control standards
493,The only two faults are the absence of cruise control and the autonomy of no more than 150km!!
494,"For the fins, it gives a powerful and aggressive style"
495,"I like everything at Ducati, the most beautiful motorcycles in design!"
496,"beautiful machine, but autonomy still hurts"
497,Too bad for the fins ... especially on a roadster. It breaks the line in addition to being useless.
498,I still prefer the 1290. Ducat remains ducat ü§£ although it's pretty.
499,Pros and cons of the fins basically since they are used to keep the bike stable above 250 I think low if you ever want to go that far you are happy to have them now against because in terms of beauty it spoils a can the beautiful jewelry it be if there were none 
500,For the fins because too stylish but the same I don't have the level to push it enough to feel the effect
501,18/20 superb machine but the problem for autonomy
502,"The one with the more torque at the bottom is really great. Since the rear header pipes are 10cm shorter and the diameter has been changed from 42mm to 38mm. I've heard about the mirrors from different people, but nobody keeps the originals anyway üòâ I don't know of any real solution to the temperature development between the legs..you have to be able to live with it üòÖ I'm really looking forward to next month when I will finally be a proud owner "
503,cool thanks for the technical explanation I only knew what was there with the manifolds ü§© you can feel the heat of the engine especially in traffic jams or stop and go moments - it's really good when driving üëç I'm really happy for you ‚ù§Ô∏è
504,"I also found rear-view mirrors terrible at first, but was able to change the angle, since then I can see more than my shoulders (I'm 1.83m tall). The heat development is intense, but it was significantly worse with the Panigale V2 (and during the test drive it was only 8 degrees üòâ)."
505,"so the StreetFighter only has one lamp that lights up when it's on reserve - I don't understand it at CHF 25k - and according to Ducati with reserve you can get about 60km far - well, every time the lamp goes on, I go to refuel ü•≥ from there I haven't even tried the maximum range. I thought I read something over 220 km - so I'm refueling a lot "
506,So for me the lamp always comes on between 130 and 150 km üòµ‚Äçüí´ Then I'll try how much is possible
507,"Thanks, depending on how you drive, but for me it's about 5.8 liters about 210km ++"
508,The rear-view mirrors are useless. They look good. Wait for your new ones and let me change them right away. Hot hotter . Heat a problem at Ducati and in Thailand. I'm curious how that feels then..
509,Stand is also not ideal on V4S
510,I haven't noticed anything negative yet. I could have mentioned the small tank (16L).
511,I drive the Z900 and have test driven the Streetfighter. Both awesome mopeds that you can't compare in terms of performance. I will get the Streetfighter as a second moped
512,"Great review of a beautiful bike. However, I feel that the Tuono V4 is still the best bike in this segment."
513,"amazed by its looks, sound, and design"
514,A legendary engine! Ducati. Just wow. 208hp @23 lakhs seems ok for something as iconic as the Streetfighter! Rishaad was really happy!! Indeed. Beauty.
515,Its A Monster Motorcyle
516,My dream bike ‚ù§Ô∏è one day this beast will be mine
517,My dream bike was zx14R but since it discontinued i had nothing in my mind to look forward to... But this bike Is my next dream to achieve.... Its impressive in all waysüòçüòçüòç
518,I like your indulgence analogy.Yes you are right ‚Ä¶none of the super bikes make any practical sense on public roads but it‚Äôs all about the thrill and you have to be little crazy to get a motorcycle.I‚Äôm using crazy in a good sense ..passionate will be more apt.I own a 2021 Streetfighter V4S with Akrapovic exhaust and I love every bit of it .Great review !
519,It's a beast
520,I've ridden panigale in the US. It's not a motorcycle. It's basically a very powerful engine with 2 wheels slapped on.
521,It revs like a lion
522,It's not a bike it's a beast !!
523,i can hear it all day 
524,A naked 1100 cc.bike. The grunt is awesome.
525,"Sexiest Beast"" is what I Call this machine ü§©ü§©üî•üî•üî•,Even this word is not enough..."
526,If one want to see how beautiful single side swing arm is look at ducati X diavel S. Ducati bikes are mend to ride in winter season in india.
527,When people say Ducati sounds nice‚Ä¶ My reaction: Okay. üëãüèª
528,"I don't have any taste in bikes at all. But whenever I come across a ducati video, I am watching it for sure!!!! üòçüòç"
529,Love it ‚ù§ naked monster
530,I still think that Z1000 looks better than a streetfighter even though its a 10 year old model.
531,Its really sad that KTM does not offer its bonkers 1290 SDR in here
532,Best looking naked bike ever built!!!
533,The street fighter looks like a robot
534,Headlights looks like the bike wearing a oakley-sun glasses 
535,My fav
536,Ducatis look good in black
537,I was considering this bike for purchase but the absence of a fuel gauge is a big no no. Guess I will stick to KTM nakeds for now
538,"Would probably be difficult to survive in the Indian market, due to the.high price and also the loud sound. You would be stopped by the police almost every 15 min. "
539,that roar is like P220 ovverdosed
540,That's one mean looking machine
541,No fuel guage? Who do they think they are? RE?
542,Did it shed its color ?
543,"bruh so much windblast, 200hp on naked :/"
544,It's still not an EV
545,Out of okaatüòÅüòÅ
546,"Absolutely gorgeous, thanks for sharing this upload, appreciate your feedback throughout the video, hope i could have one if these parked in my garage "
547,"Willing to trade both my bikes in for the standard SFV4 even though I work at a aprilia dealership üòÇ I want something we don‚Äôt sell and the tuono factory is ehhh, the Ducati is just more me in a bike lol"
548,What a monster of a machine...
549,The rear cylinders only turn off when you are stopped. It sounds like a twin because Ducati tuned the firing order to sound that way.
550,I took the wings off and my front wheel floats in 5th gear as much as with the wings in 4th gear.
551,"With Great power, comes great.....fuel consumption üòÇ. I know what you did here."
552,90-100km on full tank? Wow üò≠
553,"The fuel light lights up at 130-150 km by normal use, you can drive up to 180 km for your next tank stop so it‚Äôs not too bad. 90-100 km is probably when riding in the city, which you don‚Äôt with this bike."
554,But after 100km your energy levels would also be empty not just the gas tank.
555,"What hooligan can afford a Ducati street fighter!! I‚Äôm so torn between that and Panigale!! I have a Diavel, so lm leaning more Panigale But every time I ride a SF I come away giggling with the biggest smileü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
556,I owned a diavel 5 years. Then sold it for a panigale 1199. I soon came to regretting my decision of selling the diavel. 4 months ago I bought another diavel to live along side the Panigale. The perfect pair for two completely different jobs.
557,"Totally agree, once upon a time a 749 was my Only mode of transportation! I was really thankful to get a truck, and then ST2, I‚Äôm NOT giving up my Diavel: 1. it‚Äôs paid off, 2. Im 5‚Äô4‚Äù I can mostly flat foot it.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Maybe if I had a longer inseam, I‚Äôd consider the Street Fighter as an only bike, but having no practical reason for anything with that much power, might as well go all in and get the Panigale,üòã while I‚Äôm still young and limber enough to get some enjoyment out of it!!"
558,I love the streetfighter. But watching this review with a cringe thinking about the gasoline price
559,What a beauty
560,My dream bike if I had the height for it.
561,this windshield is so fresh. only thing missing here is a topcase?
562,I haven‚Äôt enjoyed many street fighters sense the early 2000s because of the ugly faces they put on them. Only new bike uglier than the Ducati SF is the new Yamaha mt09
563,damn..the fuel consumption....horrible plus terrible
564,I think it looks ugly tooo
565,"The whole bike looks ugly not just the windshield, but that's not the thing that would prevent me from buying it."
566,Tooooooo a beautiful bike in everything.And who doesn't like it ... nobody forces you to buy it .. everyone spends their money as they see fit.Tomorrow I'm going to order it. and don't care about purists
567,"Wow what a beast! It seems to me that here ""the journalist"" has finally enjoyed it üòâüòÅüòÅ"
568,"I continue to find the existence of aerodynamic fins on a naked that, by definition, is a bike that doesn't care about aerodynamics senseless. I had no doubts about the chassis and engine qualities, Ducati, past the dark years, is becoming more and more a certainty. I am curious instead of the track, which beyond the lap time in my opinion will define a bit the contradiction of the bike which to date has not yet come out with these tests."
569,"The fins are to be used mostly on the track, since they make a significant contribution to the stability of the bike only after certain speeds. The fact is that if you really don't like them you can also take them off I guess ahaahah"
570,"Paolo Ranedda I have always thought that those who buy naked for the track are either a lover of the slaps of the wind or do not know what they are going to face, but of course, this is my mere opinion, others are free to try! I already on the highway after a certain start to feel ""annoyance"", even with the bike very stable"
571,"the SF is however much more comfortable than any fairing with half handlebars. Its use on the track enhances its handling qualities, which are given by the cross-inspired handlebars (the reference to the magura handlebars of the S version of the monster is evident), and the position in the saddle that gives a natural and non-stressful triangulation as on hypersport bikes. faired. As for the much-discussed fins, they offer greater stability to the front end, weighing on it with an important aerodynamic load, as if it were squeezed between the fairing and the tank along a straight line. They don't have a purely aesthetic function to make the coolest bike in a nutshell. Think of an F1 without aileron in front or behind .. it would go all over the place. A 210 hp motorcycle. it must be stable in all situations. We are no longer at the time of the first version of the Yamaha R1, when the ratio between horsepower and kg / mass seemed (and was) an exaggeration and if pushed to push they made it a coffin on two wheels! Today the data on paper no longer cause a sensation, if then bringing monsters of such power into the street has become a walk!"
572,"I don't question the quality of the project, but I don't understand what such a powerful naked is for. I think that on some steps you can take advantage of an SV 650 more. As for the fins ... I don't even like them on sports cars."
573,Gorgeous!! With a reduced final ratio of a tooth of -1 pinion tooth (Z 15) and +1 crown tooth (Z 42) compared to a Panigale V4 I can't hardly believe that it is elastic and starts again from 64 Km / h in 6 ^ .. .is not just the elastic motor.
574,"Beautiful, exceptional and truly top-of-the-range motorcycle. Perhaps aesthetically, personally, I prefer the Tuono, apparently more Racing and with the least protective fairing"
575,"The only flaw of this Ducati is the price, beautiful and looks very successful bike"
576,"I confess that I don't like the aesthetics very much, it remains a great engine, very softened so as not to scare it, it seems to me a good marketing operation ... 200 hp that anyone can bring thanks to the refinement of the maps, it costs a bang, I'll buy it who he is a bachelor, who will want to be noticed, least of all one who will pull his neck for good."
577,"simply gorgeous, a rear tire that drives me crazy and a very bad headlight. Congratulations to the ducati"
578,"good analysis We could therefore say that instead of a 4-cylinder it is a 2 + 2, that is, it maintains the Ducati character of the 2-cylinder and provides the smoothness of a 4-cylinder ..."
579,"Nothing to say, I have always been of the idea that more than 100 horses on the passes are completely useless but after a day together with a person with this bike this time I had to change my mind and admit the clear superiority of this vehicle in all situations, a disarming smoothness in the fold, elasticity and electronicsal.top, I've never seen him break up in the whole day of curves, he never had to correct, change the throttle abruptly, I didn't even feel his engine, the bike is down and delivers what it can automatically while I tore my hair and risked the impossible to keep up with him .... there was no match, really impressive means and not for the moture (which it is) but also for everything else."
580,"I tried the very first Street Fighter .. I did a few kilometers and then I brought it back to my friend the owner because I was afraid ... it is devastating, wild .. This is a track bike without the fairing."
581,"It is essential that in the near future there is an option to put a fairing and a hook for bags like the ktm 1290 r has, so it would give you the opportunity to take a trip for a weekend. Right now it's a beautiful 25,000 euro salon or Sunday outing motorbike."
582,"you have said everything except 2 fundamental things: the bike does about 140 km with a full tank! (Inconceivable) and then it gets very hot. So it is a ""bar"" bike to be seen and to take walks in the city and surroundings and always be anxious to stop for gas. Or it's a motorbike to have fun on the track ... there aren't any petrol problems!"
583,"I am quite torn on this bike. 12 years ago Ducati produced what for me STILL remains the most beautiful bike ever produced. The Streetfighter. Expensive, with very little electronics, practically a rocket on two wheels. It is withdrawn from the market precisely because it costs too much and sells little. 12 years later, Ducati does what we have been waiting for for years. The Streetfighter 2. GREAT features, GREAT electronics, though ... shocking price, and questionable aesthetics. It looks like it's made from car scraps found in the warehouse, and the flaps ... are they really useful? Or is it pure aesthetics? I don't know, I would like to like it, but sometimes it really sucks me haha ‚Äã‚ÄãIn front and behind it is beautiful, from the side it is a mess."
584,"Beautiful bike, the thing I really hate is the ""urinalysis"" model of the clutch and front brake oil tanks. Could there be nothing better?"
585,"This Ducati is one of the most successful bikes in recent years but there will always be the insatiable ""the first thing I remove are the wings"" ""it's an oven it will be undrivable"" if you don't like it just don't watch the video"
586,if this engine is softened and put on the multistrada (it seems to be so ...) it could be the gs killer ... but with these bikes I can't go slowly = I admire them ... but I turn them off ^^
587,Often in the tests of the naked you are used to define as a defect the little or no air protection ... as if they were touring bikes!
588,"if you are looking for an all-rounder and versatile motorcycle with bag housing, ktm 1290 sdr 2020! and I say it as a ducatista, I don't understand this sfv4 either as aesthetics or how I use it."
589,I would go to v4 if you can afford it. Immensely beautiful and fast.
590,"It seems to me much more ""road"" than the Tuono ... which has a more charged position on the handlebars and a more beautiful voice ... But that's just my impression"
591,Ducati wanted to create an engine to compete with the Japanese. But in the end it always stays behind and has ruined the characteristic of the two-cylinder that distinguished it from other houses
592,great beautiful motorcycle
593,Wow .. pity the price
594,Too beautiful .
595,Crazy very well done
596,From the review it is deduced that it is a great bike. But I don't like the aesthetics
597,"Narrower twin and wingless, the Street v2 2021 looks promising"
598,Without windshield where are you going with this beast ?!
599,I would like an SF V2
600,"nn you really liked it üòÇ! beautiful bike, beautiful video !!!"
601,all plastic!
602,"Beautiful but it will be a crematorium. If with 20 degrees you can feel it, imagine with 30 maybe in the city. The fins are ridiculous"
603,what the h ... or need a bike so useless on the street useless on the track
604,In my opinion it is too excessive to be a naked
605,"excessive only in cost, for the rest the horses are well harnessed"
606,What a beast
607,The flaps are unwatchable
608,Including the complete absence of aerodynamic protection among the defects of a naked is like going to prostitutes and complaining about the absence of love during the relationship.
609,I'm sorry but the motorcycle model is not to my liking
610,But those little tanks of oil on the handlebars look really poor ... They look like urinalysis glasses
611,"Either you make yourself a track bike or a naked, I can't position this bike that at first exceeds the speed limit on the highway but is not made for the highway or for the track or for the road. If it is made to give gas and on the road you cannot do it and on the track if you want to make the time I use other types of motorcycles, what is the use? Can you help me understand?"
612,"Very nice, certainly very funny W ducati but I would never buy it, from the 200 HP of naked what are they for?"
613,Mv Agusta brutale 1000 is its rival and possibly the Zh2 Kawasaki
614,"With what it costs, you can't see those two plastic bottles, they could have done more."
615,"I don't like it aesthetically, just like the Panigale, I find that as a design we are becoming Japanese ... The old Streetfighter was already so-so, but this one looks like the Z1000üò® ..."
616,I don't like naked. This street fighter didn't change my mind.
617,"Forgive me I understand that you have to emphasize above all the new bikes but the DUCATI DNA these V4s no longer have it . ...... Cmq remains a beautiful motorcycle leaving out Plastic fins everywhere The radiator is painful And an instrumentation that aesthetically does not match the continuity of the motorcycle line DUCATI COULD DO MUCH BETTER at 22,000 euros not even a carbon fender"
618,This Ducati is a show
619,The most direct rival and certainly the thunder ... But also BMW ... KTM a few less horsepower but she too could have her say ... What perplexes me is do you really need all these CVs on a naked?
620,But without the front fairing it is undriveable though! ...
621,"64 per hour, 6th gear .. no tearing .. a few years ago they would have looked at you as if you were an alien, speaking of Ducati !! 
MARCO QUAGLIA
1 year ago
Yes, but you have to stay above 4 thousand ‚Ä¶"
622,Those headlights so low that they go today I just can't understand them 
623,"I would like a less powerful version of this bike for more affordable price. I love the looks, gorgeous design, but not practical for 99 percent of peoples riding on normal roads. Could never push it at all realistically without ending up in a jail cell or a coffin."
624,"obviously everything has its limits, but plenty of bikes you can drive spiritedly on the road and be fine. You couldn't even tap the throttle on this beast for even a second."
625,"Gut-Z Guy powerband is up high so you could for a second... Top speed is 168 mph so it‚Äôs geared pretty similar to just about every other 1000cc sport touring/naked bike which averages around 150 mph. Which brings me to the point of you don‚Äôt have to be going 100mph to use all 200hp. You can use 1st, 2nd, or 3rd... which will probably bring you around the same speeds as all the other bikes you‚Äôll try recommending.Physics don‚Äôt lie.. doesn‚Äôt matter what CC you‚Äôre on.. physics says you can‚Äôt take that corner at 100mph you aren‚Äôt taking it at 100mph ... so you can either push the engine to its limits in 2nd or 3rd or push some other bike, BUT YOULL NEVER be pushing the limits of your tires/tyres, suspension, and engine all at the same time.. it‚Äôs just downright impossible. At the end of the day, there isn‚Äôt such a thing of a spirited ride where you aren‚Äôt breaking the law and could go to jail, because let‚Äôs face in most areas 25 over is jail time in a lot of countries. So stop using a weak justification.. You‚Äôre about to be risking jail time and not pushing the limits of 99% of bikes... Go buy you a 125cc if you want to push a bike hard and not risk jail time."
626,Hopefully they make a V2 version. Yea it would overlap with the Monsters but the old 848 did too. And frankly I kind of found myself wanting more power on the 848. A ~400lb V2 Streetfighter would be amazing
627,This is not motorcycle. This is work of art.
628,"Love the stock exhaust all under the bike. No large ugly can slapped on the side. Plus it centralizes the weight. Ducati makes beautiful, exclusive bikes."
629,"I know some people want a smaller version of this because they want it to be more ""usable"" , let's be honest , everything is usable under certain circumstances . But , I think the V4 is great , being ridiculously powerful . If I paid for the whole speedometer , I will use the whole speedometer ."
630,"Just got back from my inaugural ride, Iam speechless, Iam ecstatic that there are 0 heat issues, it was 85-degrees today. It was extremely difficult to stop riding. If I didn‚Äôt have a beautiful family at home I would never stop riding this bike. Incredibly comfortable!! Absolute weapon of a bike!! The thrust forward is hard to describe!! Never been soo "
631,"A very honest review in my opinion... Thanks for that! You are now the second person that tested the V4S that (I read between the lines) have doubts as to where this bike slots in... Who wants the ""fun factor"" kicking in at such high rpm? I did put my name down to buy one of these .... however I also have a brand new KTM Super Duke R and for the money, pure smiling pleasure, low down grunt and comfort I guess I'll stick with the KTM. Seems Ducati wanted to make a Streetfighter for the track while 95% of ""us ordinary riders"" just want to ride on the free ways, mountains, twisties etc... and that is where the SDR is so brilliant!! Lastly I hear the Streetfighter V4 has no fuel gauge and no cruise control and in my book that is poor! Regards!"
632,"you're correct, no fuel gauge - is it really 2020 already?!?! - and no Cruise Control. In my mind, any bike with fly-by-wire throttle should have Cruise Control. It has the button for heated grips though - but they're an option..."
633,"At least from my perspective the rosso corsa 2s are about as far as I'd go for a road bikes. Carbon hoops really only make sense on the track, at least with the draconian punishments for speeding where I live but I'm hard pressed to see how the UK would be all that different."
634,"Using this bike on the street, like daily commuting is overkill."
635,"Same old argument. If this was the only factor in buying a bike everybody would just be riding 300cc Honda scooters. The great part about motorcycles like this is the pleasure of owning such a refined and powerful machine, even if you're not even close to full throttle every day, you know the potential the bike has, and every now and then when you get to a nice open road with no traffic it's nice to be able to open up the gas a bit"
636,"Absolutely, I couldn‚Äôt agree more. I had supercorsa‚Äôs on my speed triple rs and I wish they came with something more road oriented. Supercorsa‚Äôs don‚Äôt heat up fast enough plus they‚Äôre are terrible in wet and cold weather, so definitely not the best choice for a street bike."
637,"Strange you mentioned about the ""Neutral"" shift position on a gear down shift.... I have a Monster 821 2018 model and the first few thousand kms did that quite often.... now seems to happen less frequent (maybe i understand the bike better - (never happened to me with other naked or sport bikes).... I think its a worrying thing when you drive ""happily"" on an open road and the gearbox goes into NEUTRAL as you enter the corner, the bike pikes up a lot of speed and it can be dangerous, if it catches off guard or if you are entering the corner too fast for road conditions or maybe both, the extra speed when losing the braking effect of the engine, might lead you to a crash or a scary situation and a new set of undies...."
638,I rode one back to back with the new 1290 Superduke.........As a road bike I much preferred the Ktm. The Ducati was a beast all the time......The Ktm was a beast but only when you wanted it to be.
639,"look forward to the V2 version...If it arrives, it'd probably make a better bike for most people!"
640,"It's nice you did some reviews about that bike inspite of the strict lockdown. I like super sportsbikes but I'll be moving in a city where that seems to be impractical. But I do like a bike with a striking look and an attitude. I'm eyeing on a MV Agusta Serie Oro 1000RR(please do a review about this naked bike), the thing is I like the sound of a V4 engine better. About this Ducati V4S I think I better shut up, get one and enjoy my ridesüòç"
641,It looks very beefy and muscular too.
642,Does it have the same power delivery like v4? After 11k rpm rips? If this is the same then it‚Äôs not for street use.. super duke torque and power it‚Äôs early in the rpm that‚Äôs why is enjoyable and loves wheelies.. hopefully it‚Äôs similar otherwise doesn‚Äôt worth it
643,I'd never be able to afford this anyway but after buying my MT09-SP I've decided I don't like the upright riding position. As you press on you end up with the bars in your chest and its not comfortable.
644,"To act like people don't want the most power, best handling, lightest, etc etc is just silly. This is Ducati. They charge a ton of money precisely because they are slightly ahead (generally) of other mfgs when it comes to all those things. It matters NOT that we will not be able to fully take advantage of all that performance. If I'm buying a bike that costs this much then I want it to have the best of all that regardless if it is usable 95% of the time or not. So what you are saying is that these companies should lower the power and handling capabilities quite a bit because we can't use those features on the street? Really? That is stupid. They should be doing exactly what they are doing....producing the most capable bike they possibly can.
You missed my point. Companies can build what they want and you can buy it. It's not silly or stupid  (your words) to question the fitness for use the purpose of this model. The problem for this bike that it isnt the best shifting,  doesn't have the sharpest brakes or tires nor is it tuned particularly well for the street. 

While it doesn't sound like a good deal to me purchase a bike where I'll only use it to it's capabilities 5% of the time that is up to the customer. I get my satisfaction on what I can do with the bike not so much from what the bike can do."
645,"The looks of the winglets still aren't growing on me. Interestingly other reviews have talked about this bike being geared down and tuned for more mid-range than the panigale. Is that bullshit? Either way, the price puts it out of consideration for me."
646,"I have had a number of naked bikes, which I love but I am 6' 3"" and always find it starts to become uncomfortable over 80 mph. No idea what the point of this bike is unless you want blistering acceleration up until 80 + mph when it starts to get uncomfortable. Buy the V4, better still the V2 for the road."
647,"Ergonomics. That is the point. Most people aren't 6'3"" and even still this bike should be even more comfortable than a sport bike for a tall guy, not less. Sport bikes are incredibly uncomfortable for just about everything except their intended purpose. Do you know how ridiculous you look riding around anywhere except the track on a sport bike? Trust me, it looks dumb because it is. Nakeds take the performance of a sport bike and put it in a form that is comfortable and suitable for riding on the street and not so much the track. That is the point. The entire market seems to be able to get that concept (except the die hard sport bike guys) and the evidence is these bikes are flying out the door everywhere."
648,"Good response, and I appreciate what you are saying, but its a lot of money for something that is neither a road friendly naked or a sports bike. Just my view. I rode on the V4 and the new s1000rr and they are far more ergonomic bikes these days. I couldn't ride on an old school sports bike for too long."
649,Truly strange times when a Superduke seems like the more sensible option
650,"Yeah, I don't see the point of this bike either, I think a naked version of the V2 would've been better"
651,"No, I'm agreeing with ilusv here, a naked V2 would be mint, all the power that you can use on the road and still quick enough on track to bring a smile to your face! Monster are good, but they are more roadsters and not full-on nakeds - despite being naked obviously!"
652,"All a mater of opinion. If your looking for all out performance, V 2 does not cut it. When your use too riding a 2017 1299 Panigale S THIS is the only way too go for a naked. YES I have one on order With Akra race exhaust. Street Fighter has the best Power to weight ratio FACT !"
653,"My experience has been as follows; the issue stems from the fact that Naked bikes are not fun above 160 km/h; once you hit that speed, there too much wind and the 200 km/h mark is a violent affair. I'm speaking from my experience with my tuned MT09. What's the point of having all that power if you can't stretch the bike's legs regularly? Now, flip the switch, my 899 comes to life at 160, so again, if I wanted a crazy amount of power, I agree with Visordown 100%, I would pick up the V4S."
654,"KTM Super Duke R is probably a lot more usable on the road (for those of us who don't have unlimited autobahn stretches nearby), and the Monster also if you're a Duc fan... but I've always wanted a Streetfighter and used 1098 SFS's are damned hard to find."
655,"Nope. I'll take the bike with the most performance for my naked version thank you very much. It does not matter that I won't be able to use it all on the street. It's there and that is all I care about. Right, give me the slower and less capable bike nobody ever said EVER. Lmao, I can't believe people are even arguing this point. I think sport bike guys are getting threatened by naked bikes that have this level of ability."
656,"The KTM uses a street frame whereas the SF V4 uses the superbike (i.e. race) frame. This is a significant difference which is often overlooked imo. Enginewise, the KTM is a torque monster delivering from low rpm but can't touch the V4 in terms of power and sophistication. I would say it is a matter of personal preference, which feels better for you. The old 1098 SF is an absolute animal btw - definitely not a usable machine."
657,This bike looks like a collector piece or something for the rich. The new Duke 890 looks like the best naked in class rn. Plenty power and the ability to use it on the road
658,"I ordered a V4S in November - No idea when I will get mine For those who ask, whats the point - I am a 53 year old who always has ridden supersport bikes - currently and R1. What I wanted was less back ache, neck ache and wrist ache. I was considering, KTM, Tuono, MT10 etc last year - but i didn't want to give up the bonkers speed and acceleration of a superbike (although the bikes I mentioned were all pretty close) I am really looking forward to the Streetfighter - and i am keeping my R1 for track use, although i think I will probably be faster on the track on the V4S - we shall see. Tyres - will be supercorsas within 2000 km anyway!"
659,"Middle weight bikes are more the Goldilocks bikes as the liter bikes are too powerful for the street. I love my 2018 super duke 1290r as all the power and torque all below 9500 rpm. I owned a Porsche 911 turbo. Yes, fast but it hit triple digits too fast. I sold it and bought a base 911. Al least I can go through a few gears before triple digits."
660,"I will stick with my new 2019 Super Duke R which was 8K cheaper and to me looks way better! I will be testing the Streetfighter for my youtube channel once we are all out and about again! stay safe guys, Cheers, G-man"
661,"You failed to mention no fuel guage. Those winglets are pointless and look stupid, the dash is plonked onto like an after thought. A gearing change would liven it up down low and there is nothing wrong with the tyres, it seems like journos seem to forget not eveybody wants a sportsbike riding position now days that's why the nakeds are so popular."
662,This is Ducati now a days: Lots of Marketing all geared to charge you very high prices for a bike that costs a lot less on top the ‚Äúbest‚Äù model is full of plastics instead of carbon and they choose the cheapest tires they can instead of the latest ones. And it is a Panigale without fairing and bars plus small changes.
663,"I don't understand how Ducati took the best motorcycle engine configuration and one that's known for its raunchy af sound, and made it sound like a tractor. Bloody gorgeous machine though."
664,"Love it... BUT, I‚Äôm gonna have to stay with my Tuono..."
665,"Badass. If humanity had a future, and no one was dying of hunger or homelessness or lack of healthcare, and we weren't facing climate collapse, and I had a good job making good money, I'd totally consider dreaming about buying one. Cheers!"
666,"It is a nice bike. BUT it's too expensive. So that alone makes me not even consider owning one. 20k man. Brand spanking new SDR is 4.5k cheaper and has more kit. Even if u level th playing field and get the none S with the manual suspension it's still 2k more. Yes the competition has improved loads over the years but the pricing for Ducatis esp the S models just isnt competitive. The more than capable Tuono Factory sound better and is 5k cheaper than this. No fuel gauge, no keyless, no heated grips. 20k? Ducati for me really missed the mark with this bike. Its 3k too expansive and according to reviews it isnt perfect. It should be."
667,Great honest review! I got rid of my v4 for x diavel s.......because it‚Äôs more fun/better suited for the road......and god damn this street fighter is ugly!
668,"Ducati have unfortunately released absolutely the wrong bike for the times we're in at the moment - no one on planet earth is willing to spend 19K on a bike that looks like that, has shit tyres and is unusable on the road. Completely missing the point of a naked bike, it should be fun at legal speeds and really cost less than your marquee superbike. I had Rosso 3s on my Street Triple and they were wank. Can't believe they'd ship a 210hp streetbike with those. I also think compared to the new Superduke the package itself looks worse - the Superduke is a made-for-purpose naked bike with all the fun in the low end and it looks much better."
669,"What‚Äôs the point in having a panigale without fairings and a higher handlebar? The power should be accessible lower down in the rev range, especially for street use. And not the prettiest thing either! The old streetfighter was a work of art looks wise and had its own unique identity! This is just a half baked street panigale! Ducati should have put it more effort into the streetfighter!"
670,"That's just how streetfighters are, I suppose the handlebar makes it a bit better at low speeds and around town but for the most it's still a sports bike. I agree that on a naked bike I'd want more low end torque since if I wanted to go 100mph I'd get a bike with fairings, but clearly a lot of people don't see it that way because these types of bikes do sell reasonably well. Ultimately the Monster 1200 and similar bikes make better road bikes."
671,"anyone who rides fast bikes knows that past 150 kmph, you need wind protection. This bike isn‚Äôt even close to its prime at that speeds! I‚Äôve ridden a panigale and that‚Äôs a fabulous bike! But this is just a bike that‚Äôs so confusing! How‚Äôs someone supposed to tap into the potential of this bike? Look at the tuono, that‚Äôs a great street bike! It‚Äôs got so much from the RSV4 but still manages to have it‚Äôs own uniqueness because Aprilla have taken the time to tune the engine for the road. This is what Ducati should have done and is what they would probably do for version 2 of this bike in 2 years! But my question is why not do it from day one? You are right though, it will sell like crazy anyways because we live in a time where ppl love the idea of having a fast bike without really riding it fast or understanding why this bike is flawed!"
672,"I've got to agree on that point. I thought the idea of a naked was to provide sportsbike thrills on the road, at road (ish) speeds. The SF V4 is banzai fast and a shit load of fun in the twisties, but it only feels sublime at silly speeds, anything below licence loosing is just okay."
673,"Will be honest, hard to watch this review. Sound was terrible, sorry mate. However, bang for the buck, 2019 Tuono Factory has almost all the same features of the S version, for a couple thousand less."
674,front looks like a kwaka z1000
675,"Amongst things that you guys don't like how the outrageous price is not the first ? there is a lot of plastic (front guard, rear guard) for a bike that expensive they made a big fuss about the wings they could at least put carbon wings standard. this virus will humble them."
676,I want to love it but it‚Äôs not that good looking which is a shame as that‚Äôs what Ducati are generally good at. Its power delivery is not suited to the road and its 20k
677,"Why do you have to exploit all of the bikes power on the road to have fun, i think he's missed the point of this bike. Its a bit like owning a Ferrari, you are never doing to exploit all of it power on the road, but is still amazing fun to drive and own. If you over think it like this guy then you have missed the point!"
678,"urely I can't be the only one who doesn't like the front end of the bike, it just looks too ""low"" compared to the rear end"
679,Don‚Äôt listen to this guy! I own this bike and it is absolutely fantastic!!!!!!! Test ride and see for yourself. It‚Äôs a two wheeled Ferrari!!!!
680,"Wow the worst review of this amazing bike. I had the KTM SDR1290. Now the Aprilia Tuono v4 factory. The Ducati will be better than my Tv4. I like to ride pretty hard and the past 2 bikes have been great. Shame on you Visor Down, use someone that has passion about bikes, this man would be more at home on a Suzuki bandit the tit üôÑ"
681,I would go for ktm if i had to choose my next naked bike. I would go for proper hoolligan
682,Too much performance. Insanely brilliant bike Ducati but I like my creature comforts like a decent fairing going into winter down under. How mucho in Australian dollars ball park figures thanks.
683,Are you aware that the engine rotates in the opposite direction to most others and this helps keep the front wheel on the ground.? This actively helps with anti wheelie characteristics.
684,Those radiators have a really nice motorcycle bolted onto them.
685,The ugly radiator really kills the styling.
686,"I actually don‚Äòt think it‚Äòs bad, to me it‚Äòs part of the bikes super bulky looks but i mean it‚Äòs hard to argue about whether something looks good to anyone or not üòÑ But i think the silver edge of the radiator needs to be optionally available in black and maybe red? It really does pronounce it."
687,I agree if the silver edges were body color and the radiator itself was black it would look a lot more normal imho
688,"very nice, certainly very funny W ducati but I would never buy it, from the 200 HP of naked what are they for?"
689,"it's either ""kill the styling"" or ""kill the rider's balls"""
690,brutale 1000 rr has the power but somehow it ain't ungainly looking..... I wonder how
691,"Couldn‚Äôt get past the winglets enough to even notice the radiator. I get the functionality, but they look like such an afterthought!"
692,I got the silver edges powder coated satin black and threw some black radiator guards on it. Looks fantastic. Should have come from the factory like that but not super hard to fix. You can even just vinyl wrap them and they look 100x better. The videos I have of my bike on my channel so far are just vinyl wrapped without the guards on. Even just that was a huge improvement.
693,"Checks all ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù boxes. Too high maintenance, too expensive, too awesome looking, too many tickets, too many chicks dig it, to many dudes dig it, and too many people may think you‚Äôre a d-bag for owning it. I still want one."
694,I have a 2019 V4 Panigale. Not a street fighter and not an S version. Ive had only good experiences with it so far. Not looking forward to the Desmo valve servicing but I knew what I qas getting into haha.
695,Been tempted to get the base V4 - the S premium doesn't seem worth it.
696,You forgot the high insurance and all the times it'll get stolen.
697,Also it sometimes shuts down while idling
698,"Aprilia has pretty low maintenance. I typically walked away for about $100-$120 for regular maintenance for my Tuono V4. My buddies riding Ducks were sitting at about $500-600 for regular maintenance and eventually they got up to about $3000-$4000 for a ""service"" for their Panigales. The most expensive maintenance I've seen from Aprilia is $1200 for valve clearance checks. Hell, my dealer had to pull the engine to install a part for me and they only charged me 3 hours labor."
699,"Z H2 still $7k less than the Streetfighter S. WIth a few mods, you get 240+ at the wheel and enough torque to twist the Streetfighter in half."
700,"not on par with Japanese reliability though. I'd rather take a Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki or Yamaha over a Ducati personally"
701,"but when a 15 year old K5 GSXR1000 beats a 2020 Ducati V4 S, there's no point in paying for that exclusivity"
702,A fucking ktm worth half the price is more fun to ride. AND it‚Äôs orange. Ktm makes the shittiest bikes among european manufacturers but price wise it‚Äôs killing it.
703,not to mention that the ZH2 has both a gas gauge and cruise control.
704,"That's absolutely bonkers in my opinion, that Ducati could build this monster and omit those two features."
705,"Great video! I just bought this bike today! None of the videos on this bike do justice as to the feel of this precision machine when you are on it. The thrill of all that power and the sounds are just incredible. This bike is an absolute adrenaline rush!!!!! A ‚Äúmust ride‚Äù to anyone who loves motorcycles!!!!! Just like ski diving, riding this bike is something you have to experience!"
706,"So glad to hear Zack mention going to taller gearing. I thought it was only me that finds the gearing on most streetfighter bikes to be too low for real world use, particularly when riding on the highway."
707,Loved the video. After a year with the Tuono (a ‚Äò17) I just had to admit it was too extreme for me. I like daily riding and trips and grocery store and everything in between. It was hot and pissed all the time!! Such a fun bike but very cranky for sure. And 27 mpg and constant fuel lights sucked. My street triple rs 765 is more usable and it rips. Miss that torque tho!
708,"I mean, the 848 streetfighter was my favourite bike for a long time and i think the V4 S is an amazing thing but i don‚Äòt know how to use that engine on the road üòÖ So once the streetfighter V2 with like 150hp comes out i‚Äòll have have that üòÑ 150hp is a shit ton anyways "
709,"I think that 110 is a bit of a tipping point as well, at least for me personally, were as a bike goes past that power level (say 110-120hp) it starts to actually detract from the fun. The power becomes too dominate in the overall experience. But I have not ridden newer bikes with all the electronic aids, maybe that changes things."
710,As a tuono owner the electronic aids make these bikes extremely rideable.
711,"I was on the (110'ish HP) bandwagon for years... older analog machines become quite a handful when the power gets not to far above that. But with the new electronics systems the higher power bikes are completely manageable. The SFv4 has torque management that limits power delivery in 1st through 4th gear, it has the counterrotating crankshaft that keeps the front down... and then the long wheelbase helps. From reviews it sounds like this bike is far more docile than the 150hp 1098 SF... though I suspect if you turn off all the e-aids you will have a different experience."
712,"i test rode it and i gotta say... on the street (meaning low to mid rev range) the torque curve is indistinguishable from the one of the 1290superduke. ergonomics are better on the ducati for small people (i haven't tried the 2017 with wider handlebars though), engine a little smoother, front a little more stable at like 170km/h but i guess the 30hp difference only come into play at hi revs and there no street you can rev this thing on. you need the track for that... or you need to be stupid"
713,"What's annoying is that they didn't use the 2018 V4 Panigale tune on this. I own one and it wheelies like a lunatic, 1st, 2nd, 3rd gear, no problems. Changes to engine mapping and torque delivery in the 2020 Panigale V4 and now the Streetfighter means you can pin almost any gear and it won't lift the front wheel. That to me is a real shame. The Streetfighter should be the real hooligan here!"
714,"Although an amazing bike for what it is, the engine sound just doesn‚Äôt do it for me. In all practical and non practical applications, the Tuono is just much better."
715,"Awesome bike I,m sure but the MT10 is just as much fun, half the price and doesn't need you to travel 500 miles to get a service. Good to see you back Zak. Always a fan of yourself and Ari.. Versys 650 still the bike to beat haha!!"
716,That exhaust tone is gorgeous. Instandly fell in love with that V4.
717,You cranked the throttle and that bike looked really unstable. I want one 
718,"Problem is though that Italian bikes are really created for Italian roads, Harley's are created for US roads ..."
719,"This is the bike I‚Äôd buy if I had the money. This thing is gorgeous. I just got a beginner Monster and that bike so much fun, not fast at all but very fun, especially in twisty roads"
720,My dad has one of these and I can personally tell you it is way more power than you could ever want or need. I was given the option to drive it and declined because this thing is the most intimidating bike I have ever encountered.
721,"All the technology 2020 has to offer, except cruise control."
722,"Or a fuel gauge, but that is too advanced"
723,Why the fuk would you want cruise control on a bike like this?!
724,You won't have time to set the cruise control before you need to pull over and fill it up again ...
725,"What this reviewer fails to mention, is how important this bike is to the future of motorcycles as it pushes technology and paves the way for future implementation. Thank you Ducati."
726,"I'm in two minds about bikes like this (all super naked's basically). It's made as a more road-going (more comfortable, slightly detuned) version of a race bike but realistically, there's nowhere other than a track you can use its capability. I suppose if you can have only one bike for street and track, OK - but if you're buying a $25K Ducati, you can afford two bikes. There are better road bikes and better track bikes. Especially with tires, if you're a serious track guy (and a 200BHP $25K mistake is serious), you'll want track rubber. I am glad they exist because they are gorgeous, I just don't really see the practical application. Give me a basic 700-800 ADV for the road and a 600RR for the track and (maybe, rubber permitting) canyons - similar investment but a better result. Or, I just shut up and enjoy this beautiful bike - yeah, let's do that :-)"
727,"Saw one yesterday on the streets of W√ºrzburg and in my opinion it looks so bad in real life :/ it looked much better in videos and pictures.. but of course it`s only looks :) this bike is ""state of the art"""
728,"I suspect the 'amazing chassis', putting power to ground and not flipping is, in fact, overly safe electronics crippling a beast."
729,Rode a friends bike. Hooligan 100% ü§òüèº For now I‚Äôll keep my monster 1200. 36K on odometer and still feels and looks new.
730,"Call me crazy, but I don‚Äôt get putting 200 hp in a bike‚Äîonly to limit torque in first 4 gears, AND THEN gear it short in 6th. Why? None of that makes sense."
731,It's ridiculous for any road bike to make 200 bhp you won't ever get to use a fraction of that power anyway it's just for bragging rights.
732,24$k big amount üëå i guess ducati should work on exhaust üòé
733,Save $7k and get a Tuono Factory. üëçüèº Tuono has more torque AND hp under 10000 rpm which is where these bikes are ridden 95% of the time.
734,The bike of my dreams <3
735,"As a long time Ducati owner I am really disappointed in the styling of this bike. Over the years Ducati has done a great job of styling their bikes, that even if you didn't like the look of a particular model, you could still appreciate the coherence of the design; this one is just a mess."
736,It's funny to me that a quick shifter with an auto blipper is awesome and hardcore but the Honda DCT which is basically the same concept except it'll shift for you if you wanted to is lame.
737,Ducati knows how to make a fast good looking bike! I just don't trust the reliability.
738,"I wouldn't consider that stupid reliable tho, I love ducs but seen too many failures on them like parts of the clutch basket breaking off or the transmission eating itself or simply annoying electrical problems. Most reliable Italian sportbike/nakedbike has to be the Rsv4/tuono but only because they took a lot of knowledge off the Rotax engines"
739,"I wont argue they have weak points, their electronics are absolute trash"
740,They still haven't engineered a fuel sender that is resistant to ethanol. Seriously?
741,Looks like a bad z1000 copyü§Æ
742,"I like it! Sunny California is certainly perfect for this naked bike, awesome to hear even the seat is amazing."
743,Ok to sum up. Pros: Good looking Fast Great engine Kinda confortable Cons: No fuel gauge 20k+ price tag Terrible pillion seat No cruise control No heated grips (as standard) Terrible MPG
744,"nteresting review but I'd take the Aprilia Tuono RF. Can you take the 'wings' off if you just riding this in town & not going to the track? I do not see any of the 60 pounds of force being applied in street use - if you need to be travelling at 168mph. Confusion between street use v's track I say. Why call it a street fighter if you're limited by speed before you get any input from the 'winglets'. Great review Zack. For me, I'll stick with my BMWs1000r..thrills galore."
745,Totally impractical daily rider.
746,So ugly is not even funny .. it looks like a bike after a bad crash .. just horrible
747,"I don‚Äôt get naked bikes. 200hp with no wind protection. Ok, so you only buy this for speed. Serious speed. And how do you do serious speed with your head into the wind.? There is just nothing to crouch behind ?"
748,What an ugly bike
749,I hate those stupid looking winglets.
750,It‚Äôs so ugly. What has Ducati turned into? Winglets? Pointed yet droopy nose? Bleh!
751,overpriced
752,This bike ain‚Äôt no ‚Äúdaily‚Äù rider.
753,Ducatis.... electronics not good at all....
754,It sounds a bit shit
755,Im sorry riding into wind at 60 + is terrible for me as a rider..i need üò´ sum wind screen
756,Joker face headlight
757,"Maybe I'm alone, but I think the Ducati's are the worst sounding bikes"
758,"That you don't get led indicators for that money is a yoke. You do get a button for heated grips thou, not the actual grips mind you."
759,Sexy bike but engine and exhaust note is is bad.
760,"I hate those LCD screens, why can't they put a normal speedometer!!!"
761,Soo much power and such small fuel tank.How long after you fill the tank you have to stop for refill. Not well though race bike.
762,That thing looks mean
763,Am I the only one that doesn‚Äôt like this engine sound? Nothings beats an inline 4!
764,Why does Ducati release this bike in the US without the LED turn signals that every other country gets? How is that acceptable for a bike at this price?
765,It's impressive and fugly.
766,"Another embarrasingly transformeresque moto. This design scheme is becoming the equivalent to the lifted, spacered, super duty diesel for single person commuting."
767,Save 10k and get an mt 10 XD
768,"With the Ducati flyscreen, it's actually not bad at freeway speeds. It's still an issue on track though... the screen will keep the blast off your helmet but not shoulders - it becomes a challenge to hang on toward the top of 5th or 6th gear."
769,The looks just don't do it for me. Sorry. I'd much prefer a faired bike.
770,"The display console of streetfighter is absolutely horrible, Triumph Street Triple and KTM Super Duke has a better display console."
771,Winglets on a naked bike... ITS TIME TO STOP
772,Makes no sense why Ducati simply can't take those ugly ass mirrors and make bar end mirrors. If triumph can do it then why can't they? Such a simple thing to do yet they can't. Plus it makes the bike looks really nice. More appealing.
773,I dont care about the screen ( which is ugly ). This bike is about POWER and torque wich give you the city ADRENALINE... i care about the price thats too much... but nowadays when you want the best you have to pay for it...
774,A 200 bhp naked bike zero wind protection it's a pretty dumb idea this bike is an overpriced toy . in my opinion for an Italian bike the styling isn't very inspiring MV motorcycles are far better looking Automotive Art if that's what your after.
775,All technology BUT cruise control
776,My coffee machine has a better LCD screen.
777,"You don't want to wheelie your brand new expensive Ducati. When you can build a stunt bike or ten for the intro price of this high end machine. Like, racing a Ferrari at the drag strip. Stop trying to wheelie everything. Go out of town, instead of being a show off on one wheel. How many burnouts, and wheelies can you see or do....and still be impressed. Someday you have to put down the toy mentality. ...but this is 2020, so fck it!! WHEELLIE ER'THANG!!!!"
778,wings on a naked....thats just stupit. still want it!! ill wrench em off.
779,Sounds like a lawnmower while cruising on the highway...quite annoying as is lol. Would definitely want to upgrade that exhaust.
780,24k plus 500 a month to own. Not even that good looking.
781,All I can see is a Z1000
782,Too much radiator and wings for me
783,"Speaking of 2021, the Ducati engineers couldn't think something better than theese rubbish plastic oil reservoirs over handbar?? Totally wasted!"
784,Very beautiful
785,Seems like he's going to a fire. Bike sounds like a sewing machine.
786,No cruise control... for that price...
787,"Is it just me or this motor sounds rubbish? I like wine and induction sounds of Kawasaki and Suzuki 4 cylinder motors and better still, Yamaha's triple 900 cc from the MT-09 and Tracer 900. This to me at least sounds like a V twin and even CP2 motor on my Tracer 700 sounds gruntier and more like: ""I mean business"" than this. Looks are there and obviously is a rocket but that sound is just meh."
788,24K - nope thank you - i can buy two MT10 in it.
789,Jesus fuck it sounds SO GOOD
790,Way too expensive I also think it's ugly
791,"same problem as HD, cost too much, not priced for the average enthusiast, nice bike though!"
792,The facts are the rough at low speeds they handle like crap this is why I after I test drove that one I test drove a BMW guess which one I bought
793,Looks very similar to z1000
794,$24K is quite expensive.
795,Dream Bike
796,After spend 24k engine shut down by themselves......wtf I will buy aprilia :)
797,This just looks fun
798,This is a beast lol
799,Electronic suspension is worth it.
800,"that black handlebar is way better looking than any chrome piece, please get rd of those side mirrors though"
801,"You're keeping the theme going. Not a single moto journalist who has weighed in on the new crop of Super/Hyper Nakeds has put the Ducati on the top of the box. It certainly fails the ""Bang for Buck"" test unless you're a track day junkie, and if you are, a Panigale would be better for that much coin. Costs too much, range is pathetically s**tty, wings are dumb for a naked bike, no cruise control or fuel gauge, and it only comes in red. At least it still dies randomly -- a charming Ducati feature. But hey, if money is no object, and your favorite coffee shop is less than 100 miles from your house, this is your bike :P"
802,"I ride an MT-10, ECU flash probably adds around 15HP.  Around 170 crank/150 wheel.

I can cruise on the highway at 90 mph for extended periods with no wind fatigue, above that does strain the neck a bit.

Higher power on a naked bike is really best/used for brutal acceleration (had a KTM SDGT prior).
If I go to pass a couple cars at 50 mph and give it the beans, in 3-4 seconds I‚Äôll be around them and going 120-130 mph.
Not going to stay at those speeds once by them but it sure is fun getting there.
And for short blasts and then slow back down, don‚Äôt really notice the wind, maybe adrenaline.
If you tried to stay at high speeds for extended periods though it wouldn‚Äôt be much fun.

As far as the Ducati price, for most buying it:
Part of it is the performance, but also probably because they can and it is a bit of a trophy."
803,"I ride a cruiser which makes a meager 61 HP and has a Windshield. Yet, the wind blast on my helmet makes it difficult for me to ride at more than 120 KM/H on Highways.
This brings quite a few questions to my mind..
What on earth is the practical use of 200 HP on Street Nakeds which don‚Äôt have wind protection ? (I‚Äôm pretty sure a tall Windshield even if available makes a Street Naked look ridiculously ugly !)
Are we paying $10-15K more for a ‚ÄòTrophy Bike‚Äô with an unusable 100 HP ?"
804,"Not my cup of tea, too fast, too expensive, don't like the styling of this genre bike, i still enjoy watching latest test reviews, but.... this is comfortably the best review of this bike, little things like the gearing differences compared to the Panigale i have not seen mentioned anywhere else. Kudos."
805,"I've seen a lot of people making a stink about how expensive this bike is, especially compared to other motorcycles. But here I am blown away that for the cost of an average Honda Civic I can buy one of the fastest, most beautiful machines on the planet. I just wish it didn't sound like a blender full of marbles."
806,I like the look of the Ducati but I hate the sound of it sounds like a old tracker
807,Damn that's a lot of hp for a naked bike
808,"Roll the dice with Ducati..........Mine has been in the shop since I bought it, will not start after sitting for 8 hours or more. burned out a battery 2nd day trying to start the darn thing. 35k for a brick, useless Italian quality, dealer told me it affects 10-12 percent of the 2020 and my 2021"
809,"Seems like a fun bike, but still Tuono sound way better."
810,raw and visceral is what makes ducati....ducati
811,"how's the vibration on the throttle hand? It's a non-issue on my 2021. Certainly, nowhere near as bad as a S1000R/S1000XR platform."
812,Why doesn‚Äôt it have cruise control? That‚Äôs a deal breaker for me
813,Love the bike‚Äôs features but the look not so much. Chocolate and Vanilla. Some people like one or the other. For 24k I feel I can spend my money more wisely !
814,"This bike destroys the Superduke!! The V-4 is next level performance, V-Twin isn‚Äôt a performer above 100-mph"
815,"tuono v4 does better on track for cheaper price, superduke does better on street for cheaper price, both tuono and superduke have cheaper service, cheaper parts. the sfv4 is for rich dudes to showoff and thats it."
816,25k and they still using plastic brake fluid reservoirs on handlebars
817,what a bike!
818,there's just no wow factor in it
819,Under belly exhaust the best.
820,Nice to see Ducatis still have that Italian DNA. Just randomly shutting itself off.
821,Winglets on a street fighter lol thanks Gigi
822,"Does anyone else think its kind of dumb to have a high tech TFT display screen and use it show an image of an old circular analog tach? You know, a displayed analog style tach that is far smaller and less cool looking that an old round mechanical tach. Some companies really do cool display styles, Ducati is the worst, aprilia, Kawasaki, Honda etc are in the middle, Triumph are better, and BMW are way ahead. I really like this bike, and would love to own it. But it just doesn't pull my heart strings as much as the Super Duke, and certainly not as much as the Tuono. The looks of this bike and the Panigale, I don't now what it is. There is nothing about them that is not beautiful in theory, but they just look off a little bit to me."
823,That's too much power for real world riding. I'll stick with my Triumph street twin.
824,Especially for a naked. Anything over 140 mph without a proper windscreen feels like the wind is gonna rip your head off.
825,"Wings on naked is silly. They took the fairings off, the wings should go too. That's just a pita wing to get in the way. If you're gonna go fast, I'd take fairings before wings. The street power mode looks like a nice feature. Oh no it's afflicted with stall at idle"
826,"The attention paid to what is, in the grand scheme of things, a pretty inconsequential detail (the wings) is amusing."
827,"This bike doesn't interest me because it has a big radiator, it's totally impractical, has too many horse powers and those winglettes - blech. But mostly because I can't afford it, otherwise I'd totally buy it."
828,"That is a lot of bike. Too much for my tastes, both in price and HP. Nice sound though. "
829,"LOL right now there's a 2010 Kawasaki Z1000 on Craigslist in Seattle with 11000 miles, pristine, for $3,000.00 which is basically the cost of the first service for the Ducati V4, and it gives like 90% of the riding joy of the Duc."
830,Love this bike but don‚Äôt think I could buy it when an Mt10 is almost half the price with similar style of performance
831,Beautiful bike but I‚Äôm frugal and practical. I‚Äôll take the Mt10 for 11k less
832,Tuono factory is much cheaper; my 16 Factory has 18000 miles completely reliable and super fun.
833,"Tbh it really doesn‚Äôt appeal to me, it‚Äôs too angular, and the v4 just doesn‚Äôt sound any good.
And then the throttle response, my old bandit 600 responds better to a twist of the throttle, and doesn‚Äôt sound like a plastic toy"
834,"It‚Äôs likely common knowledge by now for most, but there is no gas gauge on this bike. Trip meter reset is a must. I don‚Äôt go more the 85 miles (137 km) before refueling. "
835,I think they are great! I'm also a big Kawa fan to so I'm a bit bias.
836,I think the Z900 looks a lot better than the Z1000. I don't like the headlight
837,This is a weapon of a bike. 
838,"Sweet video mate, I‚Äôve got a 2020 Z1000 and it‚Äôs far and away the best bike I‚Äôve had. Looks like itl kill you in your sleep and pulls like a freight train."
839,"I worked my way through the Z range starting from the Z800 then Z900 and i have to say my favourite is the Z1000, they are all different machines with different characters, but the 1000 dominates the range."
840,"I'm glad to hear it, its a pretty damn good all rounder. Im going to wait and see whether they continue to improve it or phase it out as the forced induction engines work their way down the range."
841,That bike is such a fun bike and super versatile for sure. Pure fun and would make an awesome daily driver. 
842,Thoroughly enjoyed it. Love the Z1000 but going to go a ZH2 tho - just can‚Äôt resist the bonkersness of that super charger!
843,I reviewed this bike years ago and yes it's a Greta bike for the older peeps especially. Still thrilling but also sporty enough.
844,I‚Äôve always liked the look of the Z series but never considered owning one. Would love a test ride though! 
845,I recently sold my 2012 SE ABS Z1000. I absolutely loved that bike and honestly the best bike i've ridden and i've ridden a few. I can't wait to get a new one and they're absolute beasts! 
846,I agree The Nakeds are very comfortable and fun to ride.Also very flickable and awesome in corners.Just good fun all round
847,"This was awesome to see and hear what you thought of it!! I agree!! The Z900 is honestly the first bike since Peri that I‚Äôve looked sideways at!! These Z1000‚Äôs make me look too .... don‚Äôt tell Peri ü§´üòÇ. One of the reasons I adore Peri is the seating position too! Just being that little bit more upright makes all the difference! My wrists and neck used to ache by the end of a long ride on my Eric (SV650) but it just doesn‚Äôt happen on Peri! You described the front end on this one perfectly üëå. The standard exhausts are ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get rid of Peri‚Äôs!! This truly was an awesome review Rob and no, the cicadas didn‚Äôt drown you out üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Thanks for your thoughts Rob!! "
848,"I prefer the way the Ninja 1000 is tuned for driveability....a little more predictable, more in keeping with my riding style and preferences, and more comfort for longer distances That being said, it is only a bit pricier than the Z1000 so gives great value. I love the look of the exhaust, they've changed it as of 2020 on the Ninja 1000, my only real disappointment (though it's easier to do chain maintenance now)."
849,I really love this beast. It is a hell of beauty‚ù§‚ù§.
850,"The screen needs the tft screen update like the Z900 , cruise control and quick shifter and it would be perfect."
851,The z1000 looks badassüëç
852,That rear chain adjuster it‚Äôs so easy and awesome I don‚Äôt know why they Don‚Äôt put it on every Kawasaki. Its because its too simple. Bike height is changing while you turning it which is not good for ie sport setup
853,I think the appearance design of Z1000 is the most stylish
854,The Z 1000 is a beast as well and I must say they do handle better than a ZX 14 to be truthful
855,That exhaust looks like it'll be a pain to clean and lube the chain. But I want one regardless...
856,Sounds almost exactly like my old 99 zzr1100.
857,Ridden a 2014/15 model. Cool bike. A bit freaky as there is virtually no bike in front of you. I felt quite exposed. I am tall though.
858,You know I‚Äôm biased. Love Kawasaki. This bike is sexy.
859,I feel that this would be far too powerful for a beginner. I recommend a 400cc to learn on
860,"I hate that the 2021 zx10r finally came out with a TFT display that rivals all the comp but the Z1000 still has the same dash as my 2015 zx10r. Don't sweat the riding ability stuff, most people have never done a lap on a closed circuit and just talk a bunch of crap, but you know that. Looks like a Beautiful day out and the sound of the insects isn't bad at all. The seat looks awesome! I agree with you on the front. I'm not super big into the street fighter, open fairing look but if I was I think the Z1000 would be at the top of my list! Nice review, lots of detail. Well done!"
861,I love this bike.
862,That display on a 2021 bike is appalling. What are they thinking?
863,"You do well to mention the weight of the pilot which can bring a nice difference between each one. Me it's 70 kilos with the equipment .. we will certainly not have the same feeling both. In general, I'm not a fan of the 1000 and their high engine inertia. Nice try a bit old-fashioned we can say that now..!"
864,"Cool video like dab, a bit old-fashioned fighter plane, but the dashboard and really and very maybe too simple"
865,"I own a 2020 Z1000R (Ohlins suspension - Brembo M50 brake - Akra dual output...). It's a motorcycle that makes us live. Endowed with a colossal power, we can do this by surprise very quickly if we don't take the time to tame it. There is no assistance, you have to compensate with flawless driving. It stands out from the others, whether by its motorization or by its aggressive aesthetics <3 V"
866,"Comfort yes, but we must not forget the rear passenger who will not be at the party given the size of the saddle. I had one without ABS, it never bothered me. It's a motorcycle that I really loved. Look and motorcycle with a good grip. The engine is great on this machine, it picks up easily at low revs. Strictly a TFT screen to modernize it. Single I would have kept it. I had it super equipped. If another thing that I liked is its 1st motorcycle saddle height where I touched the ground with the flat of my feet. I like its performance LED lighting. It is good value for money. Then I switched to a twin engine flexibility is obviously totally different I regretted the flexibility of the 4 cylinder of the Z1000. I would have needed this engine on my new motorcycle lol. When you don't have a motorcycle stuffed with electronics, you just have to adapt your driving. I enjoyed your video which made me much more and brought back 3 years back. To conclude I would say super bike with a look of its own that we find nowhere else. We like it or we don't like it."
867,"totally agree, a look that kills, let's hope that in 1 or 2 years, he comes out with at least a controlled traction and an anti-dribble clutch"
868,"it could be your next bike, it's a blast with kawasaki engines in general. you should try it one day."
869,"Salvation ! I had the 2014, so identical but in 106cv. Very good motorcycle. There are just 2 things to improve in my opinion: the saddle which is frankly not comfortable, and the ground clearance because I had scraped the underside of the exhaust heat shields and the stand... when the pace becomes steady in the virolos must wiggle to pass without rubbing, whereas with other motorcycles that I have had, for example Ducati Monster 796 or street triple RS, it passes the same without rubbing."
870,"Torque engine at the bottom and furious at the top, relatively comfortable driving position. In the default department, ubiquitous vibrations past mid-range and a tad too high saddle. The colors of the current models are depressing, what a shame not to highlight the design with this black "
871,She's a beautiful baby üëç too much for me because she lacks too much electronic assistance üëç Otherwise she's great with a nice noise
872,"Owning a 2015 z1000, a well-balanced and non-tricky motorcycle, I still want to keep it!"
873,"Nice even if I have trouble now with the 4 cylinders, it has a nice face but the turn signals at the front .. they suck!"
874,"Thanks for the test, it makes a nice little noise for an original line I think. On the other hand, as much as the absence of maps & co we can speak of authenticity ok... but the LCD Game Boy 80s type counter with the disgusting rev counter cut into 2 parts is just not possible in 2020... Might as well put a good old needle counter, much more readable and which would be less cheap. ‚úå‚úå"
875,"Completely dac, the counter is a horror but I think the owners drive by feeling without looking at it too much"
876,"Live and complete essay. It has nice watts this 4-cylinder kawa, frank and agile. A little com on the front braking would have completed the whole thing"
877,"With a 180 at the rear it is twice as pleasant. in curves ...... the rim allows it I had two ... now I ride in s1000xr, but below 6000 the kawa was better .. ......"
878,"I've been driving a Z1000 since 2004. On this 2014 version, the rear shock absorber isn't too bad, but the original tires aren't really the best. By putting Bridgestone S21 or S22, you have a metamorphosis of the bike in turns and sequences. Sold recently, I have remained faithful to my 2004 orange model, with its 132,000 km."
879,"That's the rear suspension travel (122mm), the R version has Ohlins adjustable suspension with 131mm of travel and the wheel keeps much better contact with the ground."
880,It's a bit shameful of Kawa to release this Z1000 for 2020 when you see that the 2020 Z900 has everything better... I don't understand their strategy
881,Hello. . I have been driving a Z1000 for 2 years and I would have liked to be able to disconnect the ABS from the rear wheel occasionally. Otherwise she is perfect.
882,"Hi, that's what's good, zero assistance, a real man's motorcycle, and even I'm not a fan of abs."
883,"When we see the new Z900 2020, Kawasaki has bet everything on the 900, it has almost the same engine as the 1000 but with all the assistance and a superb TFT screen"
884,I have a 2018 z900 and frankly I find it better than the lighter nimble 1000 ply almost as capable and everything
885,"I've had one for three years with ABS only, but the gearbox is completely useless. Stalls in the revs when downshifting at high revs and dead center not found. The absence of engine temperature on a sports roadster is incomprehensible. But I see that ""Loic Z100"" has this option on a newer model. Otherwise, it's a great thing for those who like motorcycles and not electronics. (I'm not bragging about the flaws to promote it, it's not a Ducati) Powerful braking even without the Brembo option. Clearly visible rpm above 4000 rpm for ""sporty"" or ""sensational"" use depending on your driving level. Pretty face, progressive power (accelerations out of bends can be measured without dropping out of the rear for all those with a brain and an instinct for self-preservation) and it forgives a lot of other mistakes during the learning process. On the display side, we need the speed, rpm and temperature. . . motor. but in 2017 instead of the temperature, we had on time. Otherwise, it's all in the rotation of the handle. Only for those who have passed the motorcycle license. . . joke. And I forgot, great video! Hi everyone and good luck during this crazy time."
886,"There is no electronics because there is no need...Except the engine temperature. the cash registers. I think the Japanese have the right solution. If we take the Duc' and other BMs, you have to wait until they are 5 or 6 years old to be able to afford them...or you win lingos."
887,Hi I have a 2019 Z900 and I rode the 2019 Z1000 for me frankly the Z900 is better!
888,"This 2020 z1000 is totally useless. The dealerships don't even have it in the showroom, it's so old. The 2020 Z900 surpasses it hands down: power, agility, technology, price. Make the rational choice to avoid this one and take the 2020 Z900"
889,I still find the look of this bike terrible. I would have preferred an update of this one as well as a new dashboard and two or three aesthetic details rather than a super ugly ZH2
890,I really don't find it beautiful.
891,Not even anti-skid or shifter in 2020....
892,"Hi FaBike, that's motorcycling, no electronic frills. The biker and the motorcycle that's all. all the rest frankly what is it for?? Good when even the counter not really readable."
893,"nice bike but I don't see the point of taking the z1000 instead of the z900 which is lighter, cheaper and just 20 or 30 horsepower more"
894,"The Z900 is a better buy if you compare the price, assists and power. My friend had the 2019 Z1000 and he lost his license. It's a bit too much for me, but she's beautiful. As we say around here, it's a Ferrari on the country road! lol üòÇ"
895,"St√©phane Z1000R I'm going to start with two points that you come back to a lot. The counter: not everything is displayed, but everything is ''findable'' via the top left button (A) on the counter. Not practical I grant you, but as you say, we are not on such a machine to watch the counter!! Rear shock absorber: this is adjustable using the knob placed under the seat on the right side, very easy to access. You can choose to ride ''leisure'' with soft shock or ''racing'' with hard shock. There is a large adjustment range. For the two shock absorbers (front-rear), they are adjustable in preload and rebound. Yes, it's an old-fashioned motorcycle, for ''the real ones''. It's either you can master yourself and master it or you buy a modern motorcycle with all the electronic gear and you do the cake, not a real biker. If we call ourselves a biker, then we control our vehicle alone, regardless of the conditions. The original tires sound blah. I switched to Michelin road 5. Personally I find the rear brake ''light'', it serves me above all to stabilize in curves if necessary. At the front, on the other hand, it slows down for real, that's the best. I ride a 2019 Z1000R and I slightly modified it: Akrapovic exhaust line which saves me 10 kg (so same weight as the 900Z), 6.4 n/m at 8500 rpm, 11 CV (going to 153) at 10 000 laps (not easy to pick them up on the open road). The sound is thunder!!!! It's a super pleasant motorcycle to ride, very agile, but greedy if you ask it and it has plenty to spare!! You don't need 200 HP to have fun. Its engine is ''full'', it gives when you want it. "
896,"Its two faults: the box which ""stalls"" from time to time and the saddle which is made of wood. Otherwise, I would have a hard time reselling it. No support. . . it's a motorcycle. On the other hand, there is real time consumption, average consumption, etc. . . (You have to press the buttons on the display, OK, it's not practical while driving.) The most objective test of the Z1000 on the web."
897,"I drive a current Aprilia Dorsoduro 900. It's great fun, but I know the problem with refueling... The rest of the group is on the road with Hondas and gets about twice as far, because for me the reserve goes up at about 150km^^ I would still recommend you for a test drive, it also fits perfectly for tall people (I'm 1.86m myself). Sound is also perfect, despite EURO 4 ;)"
898,Having to refuel after 200km is normal :D The reserve usually kicks in at 180-200km. In the Harz Mountains or Black Forest more after 160km. Record was 140 km. Zx10r Bj 2010 tank 17l with 3.5l reserve I mean
899,"I have the same Z1000, I don't think I've done 200km on one tank yet. But otherwise a cool machine. Engine very powerful from the basement to the top. At 256 km/h mine goes into the limiter."
900,"Got a Z1000 from 2013. Awesome bike. The short translation of the gearbox is a matter of taste / getting used to it, I think it suits me perfectly! You mentioned about starting, that sometimes you have to hold on to the button longer, thought there was something wrong with mine. It calms me a lot that this is a small shortcoming of the series! :) The sound, especially when the engine/exhaust is warm, is even better! Mounted the Hurric Pro 2 which are also short stumps like yours! Before my current Conti Road Attack 3, I had a Bridgestone S21 on it, which made it much easier to tilt into corners. Dare to say that I hardly had to push at all compared to the Road Attack, but the grip of the Conti simply convinced me, so I don't mind the additional ""work"" on the bike. I have one more question: If you accelerate in first gear up to 7000 RPM and then disengage the clutch, does the gear really howl with you? I suspect bearing damage, but of course it can also be because of the short translation! Question also goes out to other Z1000 drivers!"
901,"Looks good, especially the exhaust!!!!"
902,"Glad I'm not the only one with this strange startup behavior. I was worried but never got it checked. Curiously, this only occurs when the Z is warm. ü§î Spritt eats them properly, that's right. Especially in city traffic. Then there are only approx. 165 km per tank filling. üòë Regarding speed: the absolute maximum is 253 km/h. But then you are in the red zone. But it's just a naked and at 230 it pulls a lot on the neck and becomes uncomfortable. üòä in summary : Great review which I can only confirm. üëç"
903,"When warm, simply open the gas very gently. Then the Z starts immediately"
904,"Starting behavior with my 2016 is the same. With a cold start, it starts immediately, after briefly pressing the starter button, if it is warm, you have to noodle a little longer. Driving behavior with the new Pirelli Angel GT like a bicycle. Rich, stable handling, even in the curves. Fuel consumption like yours. Sitting position perfect for my 1.78m. However, I believe that kilo on the Z1000 refers to the displacement and not to the weight."
905,"But as a kid, I really have to work on the 1000s. She wants to be driven. And I have the same problem with starting mine."
906,"Dream bike, my next one üòç"
907,I also had a z1000 and I'm 187...... looked like a pocket bike and everything over 200km was a disaster! I've switched to the current z900 (as a bonus I also bought a Nuda900R) and it's worlds more pleasant! Regards
908,who has the z1000? BJ 2018 it jerks slightly if you keep the speeds the same. what can you do about it?
909,"I think the tires also make a big difference, and it's always nice to see that they have full air pressure, otherwise the cornering behavior will also be very tough, ... the problem is the fatter 190 rear tire, which in contrast to the Z750 (180) has always been a bit more difficult is to act"
910,Omg this is just sooooo sexy hammer machine 
911,"Cool bike, but small criticism must be. The windshield is abysmal ugly, everything else is fine..."
912,"Spritt eats them properly, that's right. Especially in city traffic. Then there are only approx. 165 km per tank filling. üòë Regarding speed: the absolute maximum is 253 km/h.

913,Z1000 is my dream bike
914,Z1OOO my dream bike
915,Improve the quality of the sound great my z1000
916,And my dream is z1000
917,Paaji z1000 bahuth achi bike hei.iski aawaz bahuth achi lag rahi hei.
918,Bhai kya abhi bhi z1000 mill skti hai ? Nahi bhai ab to sold ho gyi
919,"The best and prettiest Japanese naked Sugomi. If you compare Europe, Duca Monster vs Sugomi still holds Sugomi, except that Duca Street Fighter is just beautiful and the front is similar, then Brutalle Dragster is MV and Super Duke can also be above Sugomi. "
920,Pure sound!
921,Recommended modifications for Kawasaki Z1000: 1. Install the rapid bike 2. Install the quick shifter (up and down shift if possible) 3. Change the clutch handle 4. Change the exhaust 5. Install the gear indicator (optional) 6. Steering damper 
922,"I really like the Kawasaki Z1000 Sugomi... It's great for daily sound, the sound of the riding position is santei.... Wow, I want to buy it"
923,140 DK 111NM indeed the Z or Zx family from kawasaki never disappoint
924,"Oops, when did I have a Kawasaki Ninja Z 1000 Sugomi, the motor was bouncy (really good), second to none."
925,"Genuinely handsome + maco, this is a motorbike, it's a shame the electronics are not updated,,"
926,"But UP shit down in front of those who are hard, believe it or not, I don't believe that I prefer the hard one.. When I bend/over take a bend, it doesn't wobble, but it really hurts when there is a speed bump/hollow road.. It's like a motorbike doesn't have a front shock.. My MT is like that too."
927,"it's a shame the electronics are not updated,,if all cc motorcycles were small to big like this it would be great"
928,"the clutch is heavy, it's very hot during the day, the groin area is sad, it's sweaty, it's clothes + pants, anyway if you go to a red light for a long time"
929,The bike is suitable for freestyle
930,"If you want affordable maintenance costs, just choose a Japanese manufacturer, don't choose a European manufacturer because the service is rare and the price is expensive, except that there is a lot of money"
931,Just realized that there is no gear indicator
932,This is suitable for pizza delivery
933,My dream motorbike but until now it hasn't arrived
934,it's really fun game RIDE 2
935,"If it's stuck, it's really sore 223 kg"
936,The price of the car... the fuel is the same as the car
937,"Keep in mind that a nude finds its limits in the vel. max which causes air that hits you you can't keep it xmolto.inas for performance I can assure you that this scooter is scary, before I had a mt10 that even declaring more horsepower well I do not say anything else. look at the comparison between these 2 made onmoto.ittime ago."
938,"As a former kawaliere and owner of a z750, the Z range is a pleasure, heavy but manageable, the only thing I don't like that much and the current aesthetic that in the old models was much more aggressive"
939,I like it a lot
940,"I like the z1000 too, the previous series, however, had taken me more as aesthetics, is that in my opinion Kawasaki is trying in some way that its models resemble the h2 as a line and the thing personally is not that I like it, xk so they seem to have no aesthetic ideas about their models"
941,"dead up to 6000 rpm I am not aware, it is aggressive right from the low rpm, especially for being a four-cylinder it has fantastic torque even at low speeds, then at 6000 all hell breaks loose, I tried so many and before choosing it, for me the absolute top"
942,"My first bike as a novice driver üòÖ at the beginning, having had no others, it was very gouge, I felt all 220 kg and it seemed to me that I had bought a tank. After 6 she transformed, I learned how to control the gas and now I feel her as agile as a gazelle. The 0 electronics are priceless, all wrist and head. I recommend the full akrapovic system to hear it sound as it should!"
943,"I have the 2010 model. All black special version registered at the end of 2013 ... It is practically the same bike for years, the new model differs in detail, the base is that ... With the difference that mine is raw, zero controls, euro 3 and without abs as I wanted it. I must say that it is a very sweet bike if you have the brain, it drives like a scooter ... Engine always full in the low and medium range, it tends to skate if you overdo it with the gas, but still a manageable 4-cylinder ... The weight I I do not feel it, I feel my League ... I practically never exceed 6/7000 rpm because it is not needed, it already goes like a madman, above it is irrepressible but it does not scare the frame it holds up ... I have had more frightening bikes maybe it is that ... A successful project, in fact we have been making bikes since 2010 with this chassis / engine ..."
944,Very beautifull
945,"The natural habitat of this beast is the mountain / hill. In my opinion, it eats curves par excellence. But beware of gas because if you dose it badly, it forgives you nothing."
946,"has only the abs. For the rest, zero electronics"
947,From the track this has nothing
948,"I just bought a 2014 Z1000 new, leftover stock. The 2014 on had ABS and I don't think the 2016 changed anything. I love the bike so far. Tons of torque, handles very well and has fantastic brakes. BTW I appreciate your video. Really liked it."
949,"I was out testing the MT-10, GSX-S 1000 and Z1000 today. For me the Z1000 wins in the end, it is the bike that will give me the most fun."
950,"I have mine now since April, love it ! One thing to consider though.....I changed my sprockets to 16/40 and that made a nice bike a real lovely bike. Other changes, bar end mirrors, crash bars and tale tidy. Safe ride to all bikers out there !!!!"
951,This bike is truly underrated imo. I had been riding it for about 5 months and Fucken blown away by how awesome it is. I had 09 cbr600rr before that and it got nothing on this one. Its the best in the twistis. Its nimble and powerful and raw!
952,I would love to see a z1000 with a ninja 1000 dash on it.
953,Very attractive bike.
954,"The 4th gen Z1K has a stock wet weight of 487 lbs. but carries it's weight really low. Removing the stock mirrors for bar ends, a tail tidy and putting on light weight exhaust(Urban Brawlers) maybe a lightweight battery would shave about 20 lbs off the bike. The GSXS1K is 464 lbs stock wet weight. I'm the same height as you 5 ft 8. Both of these bikes would fit you fine. The 3rd gen Z1K is 481 and the same mods would get closer to about 461-463 lbs wet."
955,Good on you. I went for a 2020 z900 in May as it was cheaper. Just about to have the 1st service.
956,So much nicer than the 2008 one I had
957,"Z900 is an impressive machine, quite a bit less weight and super smooth engine (actually derived from this 1043). What were the numbers this 1000 made? Looks like the owner needs to toss on a set of forged wheels for the final touch. Probably drop 5 pounds off the rear wheel."
958,would you have this over an mt10 Absolutely!
959,"You know, I'm not a former Ducati, my first bike, which I've had for almost 2 years, is a 797... but I can't count the number of compliments I've had on this wheel. A separate design, which catches the eye, that big red tank proudly signed Ducati, that trellis frame... ditch the latter, I can understand, but it is far too bland, for a Ducati. Where is the work on the exhaust manifold? Where is the personality of the headlight? Where is the red b**del?! I don't feel any passion for this bike, yet that's why we buy a Ducati."
960,"For this motorcycle that has become completely filthy (according to my tastes) and goes everywhere, high on its feet (it looks like a mix between an MT07 and a scrambler), apart from the falling weight, nothing is right. It's very expensive for a 111hp roadster without adjustable suspensions with M4.32 brakes (when everyone is in M50, see in stylema). It hits at 3000 rpm when a Moto Guzzi considered much more rustic is capable of much better. I don't know who this bike is for... Too expensive to compete with the MT07, too bland in terms of engine to compete with an MT09, not equipped enough to compete with the Street RS or the 890 R. Monster 1200 customers will never buy this and sales of the 821 were confidential. Not because of the trellis frame as it is said here and there but rather because the competition does much better for hardly more expensive or at the same level for much less expensive. The bike will probably flop. But the future will tell."
961,"Not having been able to try it for the moment, I will not give an opinion on the driving or the engine character. Saddle? Yes, narrower... The 821, like the 1200, had a height-adjustable saddle, to accommodate all sizes, and a fairly large and comfortable passenger space. Not to mention the frame, the single arm was still typical of the Monster. I ride with the 1200, and this test does not make me want to replace it with this new model... If it will flop? I prefer not to comment. We can be so surprised by the rest of the world... "
962,"The technical characteristics are very nice, on the other hand what a pity this abandonment of the look which was specific to it and which distinguished it from the competition üò≠"
963,"Well, another icon that gets the hell out of here A monster is above all a mouth, a tank, a single arm and a trellis frame in addition to the testastreta! Nostalgia when you hold us‚úåÔ∏è "
964,personally I much prefer the nv to the old one
965,"I'm shocked, she's really fine Compared to the idea I had of her. Looks like a 790 duke. Too bad she's lost from the shoulders.ü•∫"
966,"Indeed when you look at it it's not really a Monster, but it's still objectively a beautiful bike. The exhaust manifolds no longer pass in front of the belts. And it's great. And those who want a steel frame. There's KTM."
967,The more I look at her the more I find her beautiful! I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ducati!
968,The tubular trellis frame was really THE special thing about this bike. (Besides the twin) really a shame
969,"Well, my eighty-three meter will feel even worse than before on it... It looks like a pocket bike crossed with a Gladius. I found the Monster of the generation before prettier, after the tastes and the colors it is specific to each one. Some find my Speed ‚Äã‚Äãhideous, I find it sublime, so good. üòÅüòÅ"
970,"Monster is a roadster, so more comfortable than the sporty R7, which is still quite radical in the driving position. The Monster's engine is also more efficient. We almost want to say that it is incomparable..."
971,"Admittedly, it's all over the place on this new model, and there's reason for it, but for the joke, remember that when the 796 and other 1100 EVO came out, it was already firing red balls at it because of the aesthetics and the frame which was no longer entirely in trellis, models today considered as part of the authentic Monster ;-)"
972,"I invite you to go back in time to the beginning of the Mostro ^^ It was much worse. at that time there was a whole armada shooting at point-blank range: ""yeah, it will never sell. This frame is an aberration, it will never hold up. On the first brake it will twist, etc. add. everyone criticizes Ducati's choice to remove this frame. But many seem unaware that it no longer sells. sales were down on its models. they had to innovate. and they did. The problem is not to please a clientele that we already have, but to please a new clientele. It is a bias and a risky bet. clearly there at Ducat', they put the coconuts on the table. ^^ Afterwards my judgment is distorted since this bike will be mine in 4 short weeks."
973,"on the com ducat' did not lie. it is literally a toy. precise and very easy to send in curves. despite my 183cm the driving position is good. I have no fatigue before 2H 2H30 of ""cushy"" non-stop driving. from what I've seen, decoration kits should be avoided because from my point of view they look ""cheap"" if you look at them closely. after to get an opinion, you have to try it. regarding deadlines. above, I'm biased. since I ordered it in January for a ""current"" delivery in April. and finally. for delivery the last week of May. on the other hand from the moment of the start of production. the lead time is 3 weeks."
974,I've always liked monsters aesthetically but there....average! It has become a lambda motorcycle
975,Love this new Gladius...
976,"I like it, I'll have to try it."
977,"I find really nice, can't wait to try it üëçüëç‚úåÔ∏è"
978,"some shifters from other brands, such as Aprilia, ostensibly allow you to keep gas when downshifting, this is not the case with Ducati. ditto for the climb, you need gas, not at aprilia... otherwise, you can always force it, it will pass, but I let you imagine the state of the selection forks after a few thousand km :-)"
979,"Mdr, my 2012 MONSTER 1100 evo weighs the same, ABS, DTC, trellis frame, aluminum rear buckle, admittedly it's not for the city, but for that there are scooters... and then the trellis and the single-arm ... it's something else! I think I'm getting old üò¢ it was really better before..."
980,", we end up with a plastic rear buckle and a standard swingarm... it's not a dream"
981,"this new Ducati roadster is nice, it has no major faults! And if not the new Monster it arrives when?"
982,"The monster is still hairier, the desmo twin always hits harder than a parallel twin, not to mention the difference in cm3 and power... that said, for a ""small"" 660, the tuono is very amazing!"
983,Faced with the street RS especially given the price. Nice machine but the triumph is qd in front of equipment level.
984,"I do not understand the comments that descend on this bike, someone even compares it to a shiver saying that the shiver is probably more fun when it is not possible to try this Ducati, hello bad faith! ! I find it rather pretty and it is far from being equivalent to a mt with a bof finish and without suspension or a Gladius always broken down; 4 year warranty possible on this Ducati, remember that Ducati is German now ;) . Some compare it to a street rs, I remind you that the street RS is 700 euros more expensive and less torquey, the KTM has more plastic and I find it uglier but that's only my opinion. Anyway, thank you for this test BEFORE a lot of other channels and too bad that consumption has disappeared, it was interesting."
985,"Power to weight ratio, look, price, ... ‚úåÔ∏è"
986,The Ducati in this range you essentially pay the brand üòÜ
987,"Good bein we still have the Chinese Benelli 752 for the look, and for less. üòÑ Why did you call this Italian MT Monster? Even if it means revolutionizing everything, right? üëÄ"
988,"Currently owner of a rewarding 1200R from 2016 with 160 hp. I am disappointed with Ducati's proposal... Certainly lighter, and certainly faster, more electronically complete, etc... but this bike has no charisma! It reminds me of the Chinese copy that will pump in the competition lol. I kept my 1200R while waiting for the next Ducati 1200 to renew my mount, but I'm disappointed to see that this 900 is the only Ducat' proposal in the Monster family. The MT09 2021 which has a disgusting finish still has a ""Badasse"" side with a very hoarse sound and which sends heavy when you twist the handle you don't like it or not but it's a proposal. Here, Ducat' gives us a well-finished MT07 with a little more power but without presence. For me it will be the Speed ‚Äã‚Äã1200RS."
989,"it will be the Speed ‚Äã‚Äã1200RS, a little reluctantly, I was a fan of the old Monster 1200S and R :-("
990,"Hello. Is it suitable for adults? I am 1.86m Yes it's ok, J√©r√©mie on the test is 1.85m tall"
991,"Ducati knows the clientele of the old Monster 821 & 797: women. So there they calibrated the Monster 950 to be suitable and appealing to women. I don't like the look of this new Monster, there's too much space between the lower engine and the ground. Otherwise technically it is very interesting."
992,I didn't think a Ducati could be ugly. This monster 2021 proves me wrong.
993,"Goodbye monster, hello roadster..."
994,"Ducati is disappointing on this one... we can't say that it's ugly, but on the design side we've seen much better in the brand... at a base price of 12,000 bales, it's expensive for what is offered... not even a windscreen... as a bonus at 82 cm of saddle height, we are closer to the road trail than the sporty roadster... :-D Obviously Ducati must not know how to count when announcing the model as accessible A2... To be able to be legally flanged A2, the unrestricted model must not exceed 70 kw (95 hp) and must not exceed 0.2 kw per kg: this Monster is sold for 111 hp and 198 kg ; and if we do 111hp/198kg, that gives 0.56 kw/kg... How did Motor Live (and ALL their colleagues) not see that there is a problem on this point?"
995,"That weird dip between the front wheel and the lower engine isn't very pretty, it looks like the engine is mounted in the wrong frame."
996,"I don't find her ugly, don't say anything. It's a design I would nowadays call it conventional. Ok, the headlight is original and it is true that there are some traits of the MV Agusta. Otherwise it is still an evolution with more technologies. Me, I ride Kawa and I compare it with the z900. I wonder which one I would have chosen? One thing is certain, the Ducati garage is 300m from my house and Kawa is 30min by bus, one per hour, if I have to leave the bike for an overhaul. On the other hand, I think the comparison with Casimir sucks, it's not your fault if you're color blind, but I would still point out that Casimir is rather orange and not red. In other words, it's better to make humor with a KTM. (I feel that I hurt someone, dsl, this it"
997,It's true that we have the impression that a piece is missing.
998,At least she is more beautiful than the new mt09
999,"The chief editor has decided to get in tune with independent youtubers. Problem: the people who watch your videos don't want dodgy jokes and a forced second degree, but professionalism. There, not a word about the engine knocking at low revs. Inevitably: no urban use in the test, while a roadster is used in particular in town. Result: only compliments to be made; easy ! And then, it allows not to get angry with Ducati!"
1000,"Motorcycle for small or small ... a ducat salesman tested it and warned me that it is really really small. Beyond 1.80m it's already too much, really too bad she made eyes at me"
1001,"This framework is hideous, it looks like a low-end Japanese."
1002,When we have 1200s or 1200r how to say ... We cry ... I hope they will add watts because in the state it sucks ..
1003,It's starting to look like a Japanese...I'll keep my 696 and move on!
1004,"I am a fervent defender of Italian motorcycles but there... there is nothing to defend, it's ugly and soulless. Certainly the price is more competitive but seriously it looks like a Ducati stamped MT.. and MT is the worst insult in the motorcycle world ü§£"
1005,"It looks like a vulgar Honda... There is really a uniformity of design among manufacturers, it's very sad. Fortunately there are still KTM and MV..."
1006,Ugly
1007,Ducati still knows how to make ugly motorcycles. Great news...
1008,yuck!!!
1009,Ugly
1010,It's a Honda
1011,... it's ugly.
1012,"Plastic, not beautiful"
1013,The bike is disgusting and horribly expensive... The test itself is not very happy either...
1014,MOTORCYCLE TOO EXPENSIVE BY RP COMPETITION....
1015,The counter covered by a sticker: NEVER AGAIN.
1016,Shame what is that? I don't know but it's not a monster. Call it something else.
1017,"Ugly it's more a monster, a yamati mdr putting a monster sticker on does not make it a monster, all plastic, mv headlight, er6 tank, and given the power removed the frame to win 2ch mdr super Japanese engineers. My 1200 will be my last, the lost monster look"
1018,That we fire the designer of this motorcycle on the field and that we send him back to Suzuki
1019,It is undoubtedly a very good motorcycle but it is really ugly! No interest !!!
1020,It's not beautiful all the piping...
1021,"Is it me or is this bike ugly? Well I think I'm going to stop the bike and buy a 2cv there will be more sympathy capital, more cool attitude and there I will have nothing to do with anti whelling control"
1022,For the price the 890 duke and the street RS always have better equipment
1023,Too ugly seriously‚Ä¶ Looks like a 125 yzf ü§£ü§£ Really they don‚Äôt care about us‚Ä¶
1024,"‚Ç¨11,290 and not even a trim or radiator protection. üò± In 5,000 terminals your radiator will look like the chicos of jacquouille la rascal üòÖ"
1025,A red kawa changes
1026,It looks like a Benelli it's a shame!
1027,"frankly ... it's not a MONSTER anymore, it's one more Lambda Roadster .. too bad ...."
1028,"11500 bullets. Awesome design, awesome power, electronics everywhere but not even adjustable suspensions. A good failure to predict, except for the sores who don't know where to put their money..."
1029,Absolutely correct decision in the positioning of the device. Always been a fan of the old monsters but totally understand why the Beast was built the same way. Cool! 
1030,"Paradigm shifts are always a thing... if the thing drives better and has modern, more mobile ergonomics, the missing frame doesn't matter! The sitting position of my Monster 1200s, stretched out over the tank, was too old school for me, so it had to give way ... the new one might be interesting despite the performance deficit, will definitely be tested!"
1031,"A chic bike! But without a trellis frame, the Monster simply lacks a key feature to set itself apart from the other Naked's..."
1032,you get similar performance and equipment from the competition for less...
1033,I think the new Monster looks great without a space frame. I like it better than the old one. The new Monster is a super successful motorcycle 
1034," motorcycle is always emotional, so the tubular space frame with Ducati is a must for me, even if it drives well it now looks like everyone else and nothing special anymore üòî"
1035,"I also like it without a tubular space frame, especially the headlight is awesome"
1036,"Was at the dealer last week, the new monster was on display for 3 days. In terms of sound, it sounds decent, you can't compare it with the sound from the video. In my opinion, it is also visually very successful. Actually wanted to buy the new MT09 but then decided on the new Monster."
1037,"I chose red. For me, a Ducati has to be red üòä. But I have to admit that she looks really cool in grey."
1038,"It sure drives well, the old one disappointed me in terms of driving technology, but the design was too closely based on the competition. I don't think you can tell right away that it's a Ducati."
1039,I found that with the passenger really great. A very good idea for a normal motorcyclist.
1040,"The new monster is really nice, especially in stealth black! I don't understand all the hype about the grid frame, I've never liked it."
1041,"Nice motorcycle! I don't think it always has to be a tubular space frame! If the thing drives well and I sit well on it, I would buy it."
1042,"But it's not a monster for me because it has lost its independence and recognition value. all style elements of a monster are missing. Another name would have been good. But think that they will find their buyers. It's certainly not a bad bike and it's not ugly either, just no monsters..üòÅ it doesn't blow my mind, but I would still test it if I were looking for something in this class."
1043,"Certainly a great, contemporary bike that drives great, but no longer a characteristic monster for me. I'm glad that I have my 1100 EVO, there is at least a little (""rough"") Ducati from the old days before the VW takeover. You can still feel life and soul and the Italian spirit üòÖ"
1044,I would have imagined a modern monster design more like the Benelli 752. This seems very interchangeable.
1045,"I have a poster of an old Monster in the picture frame, I think it has been for at least 15 years, before I even thought about driving. I only know them with frames and I think they look nicer with them."
1046,"Finally a driving report üëç I find the new Monster Top, just visually. I never liked the old one, but the consumption would be high at 6 liters ü§î the ‚Äã‚ÄãDukes are better there."
1047,"First of all a nice report, please keep it up. One expects that this motorcycle is better than its predecessor and drives better. I miss the ""want to have"" with this Ducati. Ducati in particular should have been warned that an unconvincing look can result in a major risk in terms of sales. 2 successor models have failed with customers in the last 20 years because the potential buyers did not like the appearance of the dimensions. Both models were significantly lighter and easier to drive, which cannot explain the reason for the failure. I'm talking about the 996 and its successor, the 999, and the SS and its successor, the SS Ie"
1048,"Looks similar to a Honda CB650R with the headlight and frame, except that personally I like the Honda a lot and the monsters are a little too smooth that I wouldn't see a reason to buy them, but it's all a matter of taste. And the sound doesn't necessarily have to be loud, but it has to sound good as a 2-cylinder in the lower area - which I don't find here with the two videos"
1049,"Let's be honest, if you're into an inline-four anyway, a 90¬∞ Desmo V2 Monster isn't for you anyway. These two motorcycles have a completely different character. Here a beefy 900 ccm V2 engine with a lot of power already at medium speeds and there a rather weak 650 four-cylinder, which needs a lot of speeds if it is to make any headway at all. In addition, the weaker Honda is almost 20 kg heavier than the Ducati. But you're right about one thing at least: the CB650R is the only bike that, at least in terms of the rough design line, bears a certain resemblance to the Monster, which the cast-iron fan boys are supposed to attribute to a Japanese design that they de facto don't Has!"
1050,"Let's be honest, the moped just looks boringly the same. Without any character and charm. You can talk yourself into it with all the technology and innovations, but it's no longer really ducati. But to each his taste.... üëçüòé "
1051,"Really beautiful is different. In my opinion, the 1100evo was air-cooled, the last real monster and also aesthetically beautiful in terms of design. In addition to the Scrambler, why not leave the Monster a bit retro as well? The Streetfighter can serve the rest, can't it? Incidentally, the 1100 evo also has a stationary noise below 93 db."
1052,"A beautiful, cleanly finished, modern bike. Unfortunately, it has lost the unmistakable appearance of its predecessor."
1053,"I think they look good, but are the numerous plastic parts sensitive to scratches?"
1054,"It needs a front spoiler, otherwise it hurts the eye. :)"
1055,"Tubular frame would still have been nice. So the monsters are becoming more and more similar to the Japanese. If it didn't say Monster and Ducati on it, it could also pass as a Yamaha. No more single-sided swingarmüòî"
1056,"Cool performance Juliane! And nice bike, I'm not a Ducatista so far, but I find it interesting. Probably typical of the new Ducati models."
1057,As an 821 driver: I like mine better.
1058,"Even without the whole trellis blabla...definitely a fun bike. What I find disappointing is the non-adjustable suspension, but will surely be overtaken by an ""S"" or ""R"" soon. Long story short....cool reportü§òüèª keep it up!"
1059,"Simply a beautiful bike, even without a tubular frame. The weight savings and other features outweigh the positives and visually the Ducati Monster is also recognizable as a bike from the Monster family.#thumbsup"
1060,"good report Nevertheless, Ducati made a mistake here from a marketing point of view. You should have given this bike a new name, because then there wouldn't be this unspeakable discussion in the monster community. Because that's numal no monsters. When it drives past you could rightly think it is an MT07, 09 etc.. The M821 and its predecessors, on the other hand, are immediately recognizable. This also has nothing to do with looking into the future, as claimed. As I said, the marketing department has failed here or the cost pressure is probably so high that one goes over to the uniformity, parts taken over from other models etc..., no more unique selling points, that's sad"
1061,"The bike would have been met with applause from the fan community and would have been instantly accepted if only Ducati hadn't called them monsters. Ducati Witch or Beast or any other new name but not Monster. Ducati messed that up and I think Ducati will notice that and hopefully fix it. And the sound is terribly tinny; it shouldn't be loud, but a deeper, duller sound color would certainly have been feasible, even with Euro 5. And the moped would have deserved it. Ducati used to be better at that."
1062,"Yes, great bike! It's easy to argue about taste. Trellis was yesterday. I want modern technology. So: bought üëç"
1063,"I blind ordered mine 4 weeks ago! Why? There is no bad Ducati. 18kg little is an announcement. Proposal. The new one for driving, you won't see the frame anyway. The old woman to stand, you won't notice the 18kg!üòÅ "
1064,I'm curious about the upcoming sales figures. The previous buyer bought Ducati because of the special. Because of the optics and technology and even because of the different accessibility. Whether the new target group is willing to pay the extra price at Ducati ..... I don't think so! See Z900 and MT 09. And the well-known target group of monsters was probably half scared off with this design. And if the tubular space frame is so heavy? So how does KTM do that???
1065,"The Audi group has already put its stamp on the brand. Such a cast aluminum frame is probably also cheaper to produce than a welded tubular space frame. Find the design absolutely interchangeable. Has nothing independent anymore and the black plastic engine cover is not exactly ""chic"". "".You can buy a Japanese one right away and save money. I also think it's a shame that the tanks are getting smaller and smaller due to ""weight reduction"". I'd rather stick with my GSX-R 1000 K5 Black Edition with the original Yoshimura Investment ; )"
1066,Think people would accept the new monsters more visually if the color accent of the tank was deeper. The upper area would then appear bulkier again (cf. space frame). Now the upper part of the bike looks quite delicate.
1067,A great test with a great bike. But somehow strange that it says Ducati Monster on it..
1068,"I don't find the frame that bad, more the tank. The camel hump just doesn't look good, the line, the height. The front half of the tank is too pointed and too narrow. If the shape of the tank was different, similar to the old one, it would look more consistent to me. And NO, loud is not out, only with Greta. Loud does not automatically mean good sound. How's the rear brake caliper? Lies down again, speak again only air inside? With the Monster from 2015, the rear brake was practically unusable and without function. Ducati knew that too, was that changed?"
1069,I like it better than the old monsters. 
1070,"Completely mistaken, I don't want to look at the ice cream parlour. And round headlights are something with a constant radius. The grille is not retro but classic, recognition and unique selling point. Tank / frame / engine looks like a lump. For me, design is something else, see SS 950. It could also be a HoYaSuKa. Saving weight with less fuel is not an engineering skill. A script/screenplay for the video would be nicer to watch, shorten the thought and topic search times for the presenter and arouse interest in the next topic. Overall o.k. but room for improvement."
1071,The new monster turned out really nice! The Italians have proven themselves again :)
1072,"Don't want to punish you because of the motorbike üòÅ The motorbike is technically great and it doesn't look bad, but it's just not a monster. The Ducati CEO often said that the frame is a crucial element of the Monster and he said it's a bike that you recognize without looking at the name. I didn't get my monster because it was technically stronger than other manufacturers. Other manufacturers can do this better and cheaper. Alright, hope Ducati decides to bring one with a frame after all, so it's ok if the monster community gets in touch üññ"
1073,". Apart from the LED, I don't think the device is that bad. I have an old motorcycle and if in doubt you can always buy a used 821 (although I would then rather go straight for the 1100). Ducati has finally installed a silencer here, which I would not configure away. The frame in magnesium color would be more exciting."
1074,What an amazing monster!
1075,"find the new monster visually much more appealing than the old one, weight that much lower is also TOP üëç thanks for the leiwanden report!"
1076,"optically, you can unfortunately write any brand on this motorcycle. and motorcycles from other manufacturers can also ride well. Ducati must be recognizable as Ducati. this is an important reason for buying Ducati riders."
1077,"Unfortunately, the monster is no longer a monster for me. I drive a 1200 r and am enchanted every time I drive it. The new Ducati has lost its recognition value."
1078,"Ducati now has the right vehicle in its range to reach young motorcyclists in particular. I also lack some of the charm of yesteryear, but there are a bunch of other bikes on the market. I believe that one screw was mainly turned here and that is the target group. Why not."
1079,"The sound of a V2 engine has to roar It has to sound nice and deep bassy In the video, the monster sounds like it's missing at least 400cc"
1080,"good report Personally, I think the omission of the tubular space frame is absolutely justifiable. However, I would have wished for a bolder design. Why is the new frame hidden like this? If the lower tank line had been left straight and the aluminum frame had been painted red or even anodized, it would have been a damn strong signal. And still closer to the traditional monster design. Shame about the missed opportunity. Driving better than the old one wasn't difficult anyway."
1081,", the fact that the Monster has gone back to its roots in terms of frames and has adopted the Superbike concept, as was the case with the M900 and the 851 back then, is something that most snots who get upset about the fact that there is no tubular space frame don't get more there. The new Monster also has a very distinctive character and I think there is really only one motorcycle in this class that can even come close to keeping up with it: The KTM 890 Duke! The rest don't stand a chance! Forget the Yamaha MT-09 and I think the comparison tests will show that! I can only repeat myself: the new one wasn't designed for this kind of ""cast-iron"" monster fans! For these classic fans, Ducati continues to build the Scrambler models, which are air-cooled and still have trellis tubes. That's why the fan boys should really give it a rest and either continue to drive their old Monster models or just grab the Scrambler. Above all, the new Monster is aimed at those riders who, like the KTM 890 Duke and the Street Triple, are looking for a light and super handy motorcycle that doesn't necessarily want killer performance, but simply optimal performance on country roads should deliver performance! And EXACTLY THAT is what Ducati has done brilliantly! The new Monster would kill an 821 on the highway, it drives COMPLETELY different than before! And now that I've heard the monsters again and also heard the drives past in the video, I'm reconciled again. The sound designer at Ducati does NOT need to be fired. He just made the bike comfortably quiet. But if you open the throttle while driving, you still have a rich V2 sound, even if it sounds a bit thin when stationary. I think the new Monster will be a great success for Ducati. Precisely because it has just become affordable and has not become more expensive like the Street Fighter V4 models."
1082,"Somehow a piece of the motor is missing down there. Anyway, looks weird..."
1083,"The new Monster will be a success, for sure. I've had five out of three generations so far and it's time for something really new. The last series in particular was hair-raising from a technical point of view. You only notice that as an owner‚Ä¶"
1084,"Great report and definitely a great bike too, but I can't really get used to the design. Lots of people build good motorcycles, but unfortunately not nice ones. The whole time I thought about what the design reminds me of, now I know: Yamaha Bulldog. It also had the kink in the tank above the engine. I didn't like it then either. I'd rather stick with my Monster 1000 Bj.2003"
1085,"Ducati becomes arbitrary and cheap! This is also the case with the new Multistrada! The new frame is certainly lighter , but most importantly it is cheap to manufacture , as are the swingarm and rear . However, Ducati has very good marketing and that's why they will sell this bike too. If this vehicle were to come from Hyosung, it would be nice ;-), but that's not how it works! I simply expect something special from Ducati!"
1086,"Same engine, but single-sided swingarm, lattice tube, more coolness and optional √ñhlins components! ü§∑üí™"
1087,"... basically a Yamasaki from Ducati. Comfortable, handy, softened but any design without the real Ducati sound."
1088,The shaking of the brake fluid in the reservoirs would annoy me in the long run...
1089,"18kg less are of course an argument. But it's not always about faster higher further. Otherwise there would be no Harleys. Until now, a monster has also been recognized by its shadow. The optics of the new ones are random, irrelevant and confusable. If only they had kept the tank/seat line...will take time to get used to."
1090,"Technically a good bike for sure, but it lacks charisma, price/performance doesn't fit either, the sound sounds underground in all the videos"
1091,"Sorry, don't pick me up. Just like Honda, Kawa, Yamaha. Most likely the Suzi SV 650. They all drive well, I have no doubts about that, but the eyes go along with it."
1092,Seems more like MV than Ducati...exhaust and lights...
1093,"When I have to listen to Ducati saying that they want to modernize and therefore interfere with the DNA of the monsters, it almost reminds me of the Mustang Mach-E. With all the key technical data that sound very good, most of the fans don't want that at all. As if you want to make a cow out of an ox. The bike is great, but please don't call it a monster."
1094,Very nice motorcycle
1095,Starküî•
1096," Incidentally, not only is the trellis frame missing, but above all the beautifully curved manifold... now even the Italians are starting to add uninspired add-on parts."
1097,Couldn't you just spray the space frame with a red airbrush? :-D
1098,Now it's a naked bike like any other. üòî
1099,"That weight argument doesn't count for me. The last real monster, the air-cooled 1100 with space frame weighs practically as much. It has nothing to do with the old elegance. This has become a perfectly normal China naked bike üò¢"
1100,Monster without a space frame looks really bad to me - I'm out - too bad
1101,The welds on the exhaust are definitely not for the eye...
1102,Looks like a 125cc monster
1103,"When you order a Ducati from Wish, it arrives at home."
1104,"The driving behavior is definitely great, but the optics are a disaster. You can't look at the exhaust, the engine cowling and the frame. plastic everywhere."
1105,Loud is out !!! ü§´ The chassis seems too soft to me...
1106,"Ducati is lucky that the new MT-09 turned out so ugly. The Monster is now at least the prettier MT-09, but it certainly isn't a prettier Monster."
1107,Bad what Ducati is building there now. You can stick any manufacturer on it‚Ä¶
1108,I don't understand the whining about the lack of a tubular frame
1109,"The bikes are getting more and more sterile, boring and faster without emotion... The old Ducati models were like Italian divas on the catwalk, the new ones look like a boring Audi."
1110,"The cooler is massive, not pretty."
1111,"Too much plastic, too bad üòî"
1112,The new Monster is and remains a misdevelopment by Ducati. She just looks too ordinary.
1113,"""very accessible bike"" is just a flattering paraphrase for ""the bike is as small as a bicycle"""
1114,"Don't understand the ""hype"" about this trellis frame anyway. I don't really find these welded and painted steel tubes visually appealing. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The new monster looks very good. üëç"
1115,"Classsssssee! We still have snow in places and it's ass...... Although it's sporty in cool temperatures in jeans - respect! But license plate holder, man, why are they all so ugly, no matter which manufacturer, I get eye cancer! We will certainly get used to new visual impressions - weight savings - consumption!"
1116,The thing looks like the pressed together tin packs of car bodies at a scrap yard. I say that as a longtime Ducati fan and owner of a 1198 SP as well as an old air-cooled Monster.
1117,That's not a monster!
1118,I think it's good to lose weight üëç ‚Äã‚Äãbut I think it has optically lost its character. Could also be n Japanese 15 years ago.
1119,This is how a Ducati looks like that has been gendered... Not my thing!
1120,you can't really see anything from the engine. All just black plastic junk around it.
1121,Not everything that is new is more beautiful. Taste is discussable. But why so much plastic?! :-) The Ducati Monster 1200 on the other hand was a treat.
1122,"too bad there are no more monsters, a Japanese guy is enough for that."
1123,"Yes, of course, I've already intensively. But I really can't see why the Monster should be 0815. Except for the front truss tube, it still has absolutely all the Monster features that it has had for a long time and also shares with the 821. The design was only slightly modernized and sharper contoured at the rear and tank. So if the monster design wasn't 0815 before, then it hasn't become that either. And besides, I have to say that there is no run-of-the-mill trend in this class that many bikes look alike. It is more the case that the manufacturers even launch very different designs. Just mention the KTM 890 Duke, the Kawasaki Z900 or the Triumph Street Triple. Neither of these machines could be mistaken for the other. And you can't confuse any of these machines with the Monster either. Nowadays the design of the machines is really very diverse. And the same goes for the monsters."
1124,looks like ne sv650
1125,Successful machine and brutal design
1126,"Yuck, there she is againü§™"
1127,"What was more elegant about the Monster 821 than the new Monster, hmm? That's whisked quark! On the contrary: the 821 was quite chubby and had ergonomics from the last millennium. And the kink in the rear wasn't exactly elegant either, but rather a break in the look."
1128,"If it weren't for Ducati on the tank and engine, I personally don't know which manufacturer builds the part. Well, it turned out to be a nice women's bike;)"
1129,"It's definitely a nice bike, just visually no longer monsters."
1130,14 instead of 16 liter tank. So you can also save 2 kg.
1131,Looks like an old facelifted z1000. Hm...you have to see it in person
1132,On the right this disguise origami with no apparent idea and on the left a hose jungle. Sounds like a 125...
1133,"First impression: Too little character, too many Japanese moves (MT09), too small tank, too smooth ironed, too few monsters.... . Well, you have to see them in the original and test drive them. Maybe then."
1134,"To put it flatteringly, you could also say the first naked where you wish you had a partial fairing as an accessory."
1135,The truth is that all well-known manufacturers can build good motorcycles. Ducati has always distinguished itself through style and technical specialisms. All of that goes hops and everyone who buys the new one pushes Ducati further towards 0815.
1136,"You are right that all well-known manufacturers can and do build very good mopeds. Yes, Ducati does that too, but with the new monster it loses a special feature within the Ducati family. It's becoming more and more uniform. Interestingly, there is another way. Triumph, for example, builds characterful and unmistakable mopeds. They have shown that again with the new Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple."
1137,"Trellis frame or not - the, I'll call it ""optical material appearance"" still reminds me of a cheap China bike. It's a pity, because the Italians generally manage a very chic design. I would probably take it as a gift, never buy it."
1138,Much nicer without a tubular frame!
1139,"I don't like mopeds. I thought, what kind of cheap small motorcycle is that. Looks more like a china cracker to me. Sorry, although I drive a Duc myself. But no monsters."
1140,The test of the new Yamaha is out... Good test itself from Ducati I am very disappointed with this model. Many small details were not considered in the design and you can see that
1141,"Great moped, but the consumption is too high. Then rather MT 07."
1142,I'm open to new things... but without the trellis ramen she looks like a Japanese
1143,"Hm, but the new one has lost a lot of character... could also be an old Suzuki. Well at least the moderator is pretty to look at."
1144,"Why buy the part when all other bikes look at least similar, but the price is higher? Many also drive Ducati, precisely because the handling is a bit more special! A serious mistake by Ducati."
1145,but nice is different I could do without the tubular space frame but a single-sided swingarm and an adjustable chassis are a must for me!
1146,"Sound like parallel twin with 500cc, terrible"
1147,"Certainly not a bad bike, but... The Bolognese don't know what pain they are causing a monster friend! :'("
1148,"Sound is still awful, V2 needs to sound a bit fat down there, not at revs. Let the sheep with the backpack go! But the report is great as always, even if the moped doesn't convince me that much."
1149,Please give this part another name ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ducati MT 09
1150,"It feels like only the 50+ gentlemen are crying because of the tubular frame üòÖ Sry... but now our generation is coming... Now make room and let Ducati swim with time instead of getting stuck. üòò I like them a lot, except for the integrated indicators that bother me a bit. But you have to take a closer look at that."
1151,"It strikes me that meanwhile there aren't any major complaints about a bike anymore, the manufacturers probably have their thumbs up, according to the motto: You only get the bike if you report good things about it. As a Ducati fan and driver: this moped is a disgrace, no longer charming, questionable workmanship with far too much plastic. "
1152,Honestly I liked the previous version more in terms of looks
1153,We both on same page I love the 821 design
1154,It looked bulky and big and that was its msp.
1155,"the current version dosent look muscular at all, the previous version is muscular and its is a real monster"
1156,That ground clearance though...fantastic for India! I'd immediately invest in a solid bashplate for that beauty of an engine.
1157,"While cutting edge handling and weight savings is the new quintessential trait of any performance focused motorcycle, but some motorcycles should be left untouched instead of killing their character and soul. This one looks very Japanese."
1158,I have the 2015 Ducati Monster 1200S and honestly it look better than this new model. Looks and road presence goes to older monster but performance upgrades are good on the newer model.
1159,Anyone else thinks it looks like the Revolt? Specially from the front
1160,At first I confirmed that it was revolt...üòÇ
1161,More of MV Augusta Brutale
1162,I would still keep my Ducati Monster 1200S over this‚Ä¶. Mine is still a monster - true to its name.
1163,One of dream bike that now landed in our country thank u ducati
1164,The older 821/1200's design is seriously missedüò¢
1165,It looks like a masterpiece !
1166,"Honesty saying, monster really miss its character. The old oneüí•"
1167,I guess that this is the Ducati's most affordable bike ‚ö°
1168,Ducati quality and premium price. But the Yamaha MT-09 defines this segment in today‚Äôs competitive market much better.
1169,Brembo M50/ Stylema would have sealed the deal for many.
1170,The older one looked better. üò≠
1171,This is exactly how you mess up a perfectly beautiful bike.
1172,"It needs a belly plate in tank colour, to complete the overall design."
1173,Really miss the truss on the sides. The monster has lost its soul :‚Äô(
1174,You can get the new triumph trident with same kind of hardware with better price
1175,one more dream bike added on the list
1176,"From today onwards, the previous generation monster will definitely be much more costlier in second hand market than it used to be."
1177,Older monsters were far more attractive
1178,For the first time ducati lookin like benelli üòÜ
1179,From that to this! What a design blunder
1180,"Maybe reducing weight can be done other way around than chopping the beefy look, kinda disappointing but hope this works out well"
1181,Still it cannot replace mt-09
1182,The exhaust reminds of banelli leoncino
1183,"Finally Europeans are following japanease ,but issue is once bikes loose character for which it was known for it looses out of market . Agreed new technologies need to be adopted to changing conditions bit it's design engineers who needs to work harder ."
1184,This looks like Revolt
1185,YESS! That's exactly what I thought. The headlight design is so similar.
1186,Look like Ducati monster150 With 148cc
1187,Previouos versions were more muscular.
1188,It looks like 150cc bike.
1189,Pehle dream bike thi . Ab to 1 lakh mein bhi ni lunga
1190,Previous model of monster is much more attractive and muscular
1191,Fuel tank capacity is very low in my opinion Kawasaki z900 2022 to is better than Ducati monster and Kawasaki z900 2022 olene adjustable suspension
1192,Dont feel special like older monsters
1193,Waste.....old one was real monster. It looks like 150 cc bike
1194,Looks like some electric bikeü§Æ
1195,Monster no more looks like monster üòÇit looks so skinny .. it doesn‚Äôt gives that monster appeal to me üòè
1196,What's wrong with these new versions... Bike manufacturers are ruining the looks completely be it Mt-09 or ducati monster... Whereas kawasaki is doing amazing job in upgrading their looks
1197,Looks like revolt electric bike..yuk
1198,Looks cute
1199,Doesn‚Äôt look like the MONSTER it used to be anymore.üëéüèª
1200,It's looks like a revolt bike üòÇ
1201,Italian beauty
1202,monster had special recognized because of its bulkiness now it has been gone. so we prefer pulsar 400 over this
1203,Copied mv agusta but didn't match the looks that beast
1204,Looks are disappointing.. Except that bike is and always a MONSTER...
1205,The older tank was dope. This looks like a shaded monster. Sorry.
1206,"Idk if it‚Äôs the audio but the bike sounds terrible, like a 150cc with a chapri exhaust"
1207,I tested this bike recently and agreed to the points you made. It is definitely something special.
1208,Being a motorcycle mechanic. I've owned so many different bikes. The best all around bike I've ever ridden. Taking it coast to coast US next year. Awesome video. Awesome bike!
1209,I‚Äôve owned it for about 3 weeks now. Put about 3000 miles on it. It‚Äôs such a fun bike great for touring as well!
1210,I think the new monster is amazing I tested it recently. About reliability I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much of a concern with modern ducatis. I have a 2013 Monster 795 and it has been reliable since the start similar with other owners as well who never find reliability an issue. Maintenance cost however is on a different level compared to Japanese bikes :)
1211,"I'm Malaysian as well. Went from Duke 390 as my first bike to Street Triple RS. Was considering between 790 Duke, Monster and Street Triple RS, but ultimately went for the STRS as it's more usable as a daily rider in our Malaysian heat. The 790 and Monster would be more fun for weekend rides but they're just too rough and hot for in town use."
1212,If ya keep it in urban I think it could be a great starter bike! It‚Äôs kinda like 3 bikes in one with the modes!
1213,"That gas tank and headlight are what kill it for me. I get the trellis frame is gone for a reason, but they could have kept it a little less common looking. To be fair, it's a great looking bike up close in person, but it doesn't look ""Monster"" to me"
1214,I own this bike and although brilliant my main issue is Ducati. They aren‚Äôt releasing for some time access to the ECU therefore you can‚Äôt Map it or upgrade to a Decat option. Termignoni are insanely expensive and dont add much in terms of performance.
1215,"I‚Äôd only be hesitant because of the heat, and the price here in the states. In my area it‚Äôs close to $15k otd. Yikes. My mt10 was cheaper. Cheers üëçüëç"
1216,I must admit the new one seems strange to look at. I am more acquainted with the trellis frame. Whenever I see the trellis design it suggest to me that bike is a Ducati. Specially on a Monster series.
1217,Im glad they built it like this...my 2013 monster will just go up in value.
1218,"Surprisingly similar specs to my 1100 evo. As if the 1200 Monster was the wrong direction. Full disclosure, I have owned both."
1219,"All modern bikes get really hot, and Euro 5 compliants do not help neither. Awesome bike and yes it is still a Monster perhaps even better."
1220,"For sure it does perform better than the previous monsters, but it somehow loses the sexyness and the wow Factor of the old monster"
1221,Not at all. Fromy my pointbof view‚Ä¶This one is so much more sexy with huge wow factor comparing to older ones
1222,"Put this bike next to a 1200S, you clearly didn't"
1223,from my perpective is the new one the most beautiful Monster ever made.
1224,"I want to say that 3rd gen Monster, is a proper monster, first because it looks like a monster, and then because it has multiple engines, not a single engine like the 937. Even the first gen Monster, the good old S4RS has a superbike engine with 130hp, full ohlins suspension.... It's a full one ""Monster"" of a naked bike... The new Monster is a middle weight toy, it went downmarket. Even the brakes are out of a 2014 Monster 821. For context, KTM puts Brembo Stylema in the 890R, that's the superbike brakes that the Panigale V4R has + fully adjustable WP suspension. As for looks, regardless if you like or not, this doesn't look like a Monster, a Monster has a certain aesthetics, just like the Porsche 911 has. You looks at Porsche 911, regardless if it's from 1964 or 2021, it looks like a 911, it's instantly recognizeable as a 911... The Monster used the be Ducati's 911, but now it looks like a japanese bike..."
1225,"The original Monster was only a 900 the first year, and it didn't get the superbike engine until 8 years later. 2nd gen started with the 696, 1100 the next year, and the 796 2 more years later. Similar story with the 3rd gen, with the 1200 announced first, followed by the 821 the next year. All this is to say it's far too soon to know if this is the only engine option, or even the only spec that will be available. I suspect an upmarket version with high-end suspension and maybe a single-sided swingarm will come soon. You need to chill out about the 3rd gen Monsters - they barely have a trellis frame (as if that counts for anything) and are oversized, overweight cows of a bike - they're fast, but power isn't everything. They are the outlier in the Monster lineage and not the high water mark. The trellis frame was not anything special - it's just what Ducati had on hand. Since you bring up 911s, you sound like someone who thought the 996 wasn't a real 911 because it went liquid cooled."
1226,It looks like a 125cc in reallife.. 821 was king
1227,"Yamaha MT09 SP better value for your money and honestly a better motorcycle. Cheaper price tag, cheaper insurance, cheaper maintenance, massive aftermarket support, massive dealership network"
1228,Awesome Bike. Just bought it a few days ago
1229,So glad I got a 2020 1200S before they butchered the look by removing the trellis.
1230,It's as if the Monster 1200 S ate a whole bunch of soy beans and came out like that... Monster 821 is the best Monster ever built
1231,üòçüòçüî•üî•fav ducati bike.
1232,It is a false myth that Ducati nowadays is not as reliable as other brands; actually it is the opposite in many cases.
1233,"I have just completed 1000 Kms, and had the first service at Ducati. To be fair, I do agree on the heat part but comparatively rest of the things like handling, weight, ergonomics, looks and design‚Ä¶ all are top notch and I never felt like I‚Äôm riding a 937cc bike. Very easy to maneuver in the city and pretty good on freeways"
1234,That is a handsom bike.üí™
1235,Maybe it's just the paint scheme that makes it look really cheap üòí
1236,Yes i am with you on the paint. In may i ordered the plus model in red but when i saw it i was disapointet so i got the dark stealth insted and i am so in love.It is realy easy to ride and it is light like a scooter. In one word awesome bike.
1237,I am japanese. I love Ducati's new monster
1238,Pretty sure their Monster sales have been slower than usual. OK the trellis frame is gone but the exhaust design is horrible.
1239,This looks likes the Dragster!!! GRANDE
1240,"This new monster just looks like any Japanese Bike, but in red"
1241,it has an uncanny resemblance to gixxer 2021 fi
1242,To be honest it looks like a taller diavel
1243,but it doesn't look like a monster anymore
1244,the brake and clutch tank are too exposed... kinda not right to my eyes..
1245,"Nah üëé its an epic ruin for an iconic model, it looks more like a generic Japanese mt07 ü§¶for price of an Italian bike"
1246,It looks sexy! Sounds sexy!
1247,Don't buy one . I just bought a 2022. Rear foot peg fell off and the ABS trouble light is flashing on and off . Only 1000 miles on it . Just paid for the 600 mile service maint . The steering wobbles over 65 mph . Suspension is too soft and non adjustable . Over heats in stop and go traffic . Over priced . Mirrors aren't fully adjustable. Mine has fuel gauge . Bars and miles .
1248,I LIKE THIS MANNNNNNNNNNN
1249,Revolt rv 400
1250,Treliss frame is goneüòîüòîüòîüòîüòî
1251,"Ugly... How to kill an almost 30 year old heritage. This should have been a standalone model, it should called monster, much less replace the lineup."
1252,I understand and agree with Ducati's choices and I can only congratulate the team that developed this new Monster. 
1253,"Wonderful bike from practically every point of view, certainly it has brought enormous improvements compared to past models .. only flaw? They called her ""Monster"" .."
1254,"Beautiful motorcycle. I see no reason to hate her other than being an old line obsessed fanboy. And finally it is worth the price it costs, which is not cheap."
1255,"Surely it is the best monster ever, but such a move in the past did not bear much fruit, just look at the change of pace with the 696/796/1100 ... moral of the story? they returned to a monster more faithful to her origins."
1256,"The only aesthetic defect that I find, but it is common to all modern motorcycles, is the flattened ""nose"", with these thin LED groups it seems that the headlight is missing when looking at it from the side. In any case, I, who are heavy, would expect an evolved version with adjustable suspensions."
1257,"Nice try! üëç For me now it is confused with any other similar motion, as opposed to the progenitor which was unique and recognizable. I also find this rather awkward, but this is subjective. I hope I'm wrong, but I really think it's going to be an epic commercial flop."
1258,"At the moment it is the best-selling motorcycle in Italy for the Ducati brand without it having been brought to the dealer yet, many purchases in a poke. Evidently the general opinion is very different "
1259,What a show I'm new Monster 
1260,"Thanks for this information, for me this monster is also suitable for girls and women to approach motorcycling it is easy to ride, yes it is a different monster you may like it or not, but to start riding a motorcycle it is okay it is a different ducati"
1261,"Visceral the right adjective, M 900 what more can I say ‚úå"
1262,"I like it very aesthetically, the only thing is at the bottom it seems that something is missing, a nice tip would be needed"
1263,Same feeling! It looks too empty underneath
1264,"Here everyone preferred the previous model, but evidently they did not buy them otherwise the increasingly scarce sales numbers are not explained !!!"
1265,Ducati is faithful to its tradition of novelty. Wonderful !
1266,Beautiful and very valid! Super
1267,"Premise: I have a rather ""complicated"" relationship with Ducati (due to an unpleasant fact that I am not here to tell); having said that, I will not enter the ""yes / no"" trellis ""controversy"", nor in my purely aesthetic evaluation (what is beautiful is not beautiful but what one likes is beautiful) or relating to the performance of the bike which, according to the very good Edo are definitely fun. But what I feel like saying is that this bike is ... A bike ... it lacks that undeniable charisma that (almost) all Ducatis have ... it seems to me a good bike but definitely anonymous; as others have written before me ... on the tank it could be written Yamaha, Suzuki .... Honda ... and nobody would notice. Apart from the above (sorry Edo ...) the price seems to me a bit exaggerated ... 12000 euros is 2000 euros more than a Yamaha MT-09 ... bike always in my opinion just as anonymous but with superior performance and equipment. .."
1268,"Given that I really like the new line (although I too see it a bit ripped off by the Brutale 800), I wonder if it is the right move to lose those characteristics that have distinguished the brand for years, on a bike that does not want to reach the excellence neither for the track nor for long journeys and on which I believe that the Ducati buyer is willing to accept some compromises in order to maintain the Ducati DNA .... I would not want this aspect together with the price not really to scream many possible buyers on other competing models such as KTM and Triumph ...... And anyway .... an applause and Edo for the combination of shoes-motorcycle color üëç"
1269,"Beautiful proof, beautiful everything. Easy, soft, fun, modern, perfect, light ... but ANONYMOUS. Where does it convey visual emotions? Where is it that seeing it pass, you turn around and point at it you say: ""Look, it's the new Monster !!!"". It looks like any other modern naked bike ... What the old models stood out from the crowd and will continue to be unique."
1270,"I tested it this weekend in the Ducati open week. In the saddle you immediately feel that it is very light. A bicycle. The engine is frightening ... the couple takes your arms off with the race map. Crazy brakes! Super fun quick shifter. I was cornering twice as much as my bike (and had been riding it for 5 minutes). Immediate confidence. Faults: it was 20 degrees and the sun. I stopped 3 minutes at the traffic lights and I was literally on fire. In a very short time it was 100 degrees and the side engine was hot. At low speeds the sound of the engine is not that great ... it is a bit of a tractor. When you open it gets better . It's a track bike without fairings. In the city in my opinion it is not manageable. Aesthetically, now that I've seen it live and guided it ... unfortunately ... it's the ugliest of all."
1271,"It only needs to be said that it is a ducati, without adding anything else. Fantastic üòÄüòÄ"
1272,"It will be a bomb to ride for sure but aesthetically it looks like a collage of parts from other bikes! Then it's always those changes that are hard to digest. Even the panigale v4 was not well received because the era of the twin cylinder was ending but boy, what a bomb!"
1273,"yes but also the Panigale v4 the previous months the ducati purists had turned up their noses! Then perhaps it was easier to accept it since the Moto GP had had the v4 for years now! But the panigale in my opinion is aesthetically better! And then perhaps new technologies are better accepted because it has to perform on the track. The monster instead you use it on the street and the eye and the heart are the masters. In my opinion, it doesn't matter if it goes harder when cornering, removing the pylon was definitely too much for those who have always dreamed of the monster! This monster has nothing revolutionary that doesn't already exist. It looks like a ktm Duke with the MV headlight and the triumph tail: /"
1274,"With the trellis it was beautiful. But in his time, if someone chose to use the trellis frame in Ducati they certainly didn't do it for aesthetic taste. He did it because he thought there was a performance advantage. Motorcycling is not a pret-a-porter catwalk ..."
1275,"The bike is beautiful but I was expecting a bit more overbearing and nasty noise, maybe it doesn't make the microphone."
1276,"This new monster just looks like any Japanese Bike, but in red üò≠¬†@ Moto.it¬†i don't have blinders and i'm not a nostalgic i agree with everything you said except on the riding position of the monster 1200 ... only one degree less than this so excellent .. the monster 1200 r even with sporty driving when you pull its neck does not move it is stable, precise and manageable despite the long wheelbase, it suggests the opposite .. but once the suspension is set the chassis is stable and precise thanks also to the standard Marchesini forged rims so I feel I disagree on the fact that all monsters move."
1277,Is beautiful.
1278,"Finally they have introduced the fuel level in the dashboard! üòÇ Beautiful, but I prefer the Duke 890R!"
1279,From the video it moves well between the curves and the engine has the right power. But aesthetically it is ugly.
1280,"They went in the right direction in everything, lighter and not exaggerated chivalry ... But aesthetically truly anonymous."
1281,"My opinion eh ... But the line has lost a lot, it looks like a benelli of the Chinese cycle"
1282,"by removing a distinctive feature such as the trellis ""obviously by necessity"" it makes it homogeneous to many others "
1283,"The only thing that sucks is the electronics ..! I want to drive the bike, not the fucking control units ..!"
1284,Surely it will be improved in everything but to see it is a cross between a Gladius and an FZ6. It doesn't convince me very much ...
1285,horrible
1286,Beautiful is beautiful but it seems copied from the brutal ... zero originality
1287,"Nice, clean, it's as easy as a bike. But don't call it Monster !! ... The Monster is another thing."
1288,CALLING HIM MONSTER IS A HERESY!
1289,Mamma mia what üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©üí©
1290,sound sounds awful ....
1291,"This is not a monster, just changing the name would have been fairer"
1292,"I've had them all and I don't see any differences. Everything evolves and modernizes! Sales will talk, like when the v4 came out, open up how many have said, but is it the best-selling sports car, the new multi v4? It does not have the Desmo, it is not Ducati and it is already the 4th best-selling bike since it came out, so the rumors are at 0, then everyone has their own tastes."
1293,"3000 miles on it. It's such a fun bike great for touring as well!Everything, except a monster, nice product for the rest"
1294,"Unfortunately, without a trellis it lacks characterüò¢"
1295,"Indeed, to read all the comments, the majority. The bike is anonymous, and I don't like it very much. Indeed, to many it makes their own horror. Check here and in other channels, including foreign ones, the criticisms are always the same ... we bet it will be a sales flop?"
1296,Beautiful MV Agusta! My Burgman 400 k8 sounds better!
1297,It pains me to say it but it looks like a Benelli.
1298,"Porco cane what ugliness, what a pity .. the latest model was a splendor, it was a motorcycle .. what a pity."
1299,Deadly boredom
1300,Bella is MV. Ah no sorry.
1301,She looks like any Japanese :(
1302,"Ok, nice bike, nothing to say but it's not a Monster! They should have had the courage to call it differently and deliver the ""Monster"" brand to history. Ps: I bought a Monster in '93 if I remember the year correctly. Great bike but the draw was poor even for the time;)"
1303,"Finally we look forward instead of backward, I say this as a non-Ducati driver: it was time!"
1304,UNBELIEVABLE!
1305,"When the benelli 752s is more ""monster"" than the new 937 ducati ..."
1306,"Beautiful, modern ok, but what a shit sound"
1307,In fact it is urgent to change the muffler immediately
1308,"certainly a valid bike, but aesthetically it is questionable to say the least. what's the point of making a skid if you then fill it with plastic lids? then rather than studying a particular fairing, something innovative as befits ducati. seeing that profile makes them more than regret the trellis .."
1309,It seems the only problem with this bike is its name.
1310,it has an impersonal aesthetic that is frightening and I don't know how you didn't notice an engine hidden by an ocean of dirty plastic. On a naked. Brilliant.
1311,The new Ducati Brutale is beautiful!
1312,Ugly but fun
1313,It's uglier than an Equitalia folder ...
1314,"Then it sure will be a great bike, but don't call it Monster. It looks more like a brutal or a Japanese motorcycle. Pity."
1315,"the ugliest ducati ever, and I say this as a ducatista fan ...."
1316,11300 euros and adjustable suspensions 
1317,"What crap! .... in my opinion a commercial error, you can not call it Monster"
1318,"I respect the Ducati brand a lot but I would never spend eleven thousand euros for this bike ... I think the market offers better at that price ... then everyone has their own tastes, and with their money they buy what they want."
1319,"THE ELECTRONICS AND CHASSIS ARE DEFINITELY IMPROVED, BUT IT LOOKS A GLUED COPY OF THE MV AGUSTA BRUTALE, BUT WITH 30 HP LESS"
1320,I don't consider it a Ducati
1321,Whoever drew it or just thought of it should be arrested
1322,good performance but a bike I would never take! if I want something anonymous there are other brands that cost less.
1323,Nice but sounds like a ride-on mower
1324,"Motorcycle which, unfortunately, does not arouse emotions in me"
1325,sounds like my nephew's electric motorcycle: D
1326,"Aesthetically it sucks! I had two S4Rs, those were Ducatis ..."
1327,"Where is the trellis? what the heck of Monster did they do, looks like 'na Japanese ?"
1328,The new brutal red is what this Monster would like to be
1329,You haven't convinced me üòí
1330,Very bad ..... who like me has had the M 900 with carburetors and valves ... knows what I'm talking about. This is a bike like many others ..... made for all those who were bothered by the noise of the clutch ringing and it was hard to pull the lever very hard ..... The 1993 one was a bike for men with balls. ...
1331,"Ugly, classic Japanese lines, lost the charm of Italian design, bike that in 4/5 years will already be old and out of fashion, other than 28 years, the problem is not the trellis but it is precisely the design of the bike that is wrong, certainly not An Italian designed it, the technical equipment and the chassis are certainly of a high level, but the suspension sector is not adequate for the price and performance of the bike, in 2021, a completely new project without mono and adjustable forks make me go back 28 years old, especially for ducati which is a brand famous for its sportiness Surely those who buy the new monster from today will no longer stand out as before, when I already recognized a ducati 500 meters away, then for a bike with lines so anonymous, not very distinctive and so similar to other brands, there is noit is more the sense of spending 2/3000 euros more than the competition, a simple ducati writing on the tank is not worth all this money."
1332,Congratulations Suzuki ... great iron
1333,what noise does it make? üôà
1334,"The engine area is horrible: a jumble of black. Well, nothing to do with the ""old"" bike, where the engine was set in a beautiful exposed trellis. De gustobus!"
1335,"but really, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãhard plastic covering the engine, inside any frame. What a mess."
1336,"We can't say ugly, but the exhausts and the headlight are too similar to the Mv Brutale!"
1337,it is not a monster .. but worse it is not a ducati
1338,She looks like any Japanese woman
1339,How to ruin a masterpiece .. A motorcycle for Giangi
1340,A bit of Brutale and a lot of Jap plastic ... aesthetically you can do better even if I already see a thrilling accessories catalog! Ugly sound ... so first impact MEH ... to be reviewed!
1341,"I do not doubt that there is a lot of stuff to drive, but aesthetically it has deteriorated a lot ... Don't call it Monster"
1342,"Aesthetically it looks like a Japanese, honestly I prefer the previous lines."
1343,"I am a Ducatista ,,, I own a ducati Moster 821vred ... the new Monster does not reflect the values ‚Äã‚Äãof a myth born more than 25 years .... the other models are all splendid ... but this has nothing to do with a bat with the Ducati style"
1344,Mmmmmh ... I think the monster was as good as it was ..
1345,"Over budget for a naked, the Z900 beats it in sales"
1346,"nothing comes back, the stripped naked V4 is the streetfighter so this is more of a small streetfighter than a monster. The monster should be the nude of a supersport. Surely it will go very well but he has nothing left of monsters. If you put on the streetfighter headlight it would be little Street. In the end it is a mixture of references to the past and to the v4 that I don't like and it looks like a Japanese app"
1347,"I'm sorry but beyond the technical improvements this bike says nothing to me and I'm sure that after seeing it I will forget it really quickly .. for me the monster was already beautiful by itself even with its ""imperfections"" this one honestly goes to line up with the other naked jap .. I foresee an increase in the prices of used cars for the old monsters and the end of a motorcycling icon. Personal opinion clearly."
1348,"I like how the old Monster looked much more, but this is probably better. I like the idea of the low-end shove. Wider service intervals, especially valve checks?"
1349,"I like the looks and i really like the blinker placement. More manufacturers should do this, and maybe also on the rear to not have dangly bits hanging around"
1350,"Great review as always. I‚Äôm not against evolution, but the Monster 1200R (+50 hp) is still the ultimate Monster in my opinion."
1351,"Honestly, starting with the 696 I thought Monsters had lost the retro look anyway. The trellis frame looked more and more out of place with the rest of the styling changes... glad to see a proper refresh of the Monster."
1352,"street Triple 765 would have been a more equal comparison than the trident... more power, better adjustable suspension! I guess the rest is down to looks"
1353,"Having the chance to own different bikes from different manufacturers i can confirm what you say about how Ducati's have a distinctive characteristic to how they ride (slow wheelies, clutch feel, etc.). The Panigale 1299 and Multistrada V4 that I owned and now own are bikes much harder to wheelie for longer distances than any ktm or Yamaha I've owned"
1354,Didn't like the Monster though.
1355,I do like the look of the 821 more and have wanted one for a long time but I believe this is about 40lbs lighter. Definitely gotta take that into consideration
1356,"Oddly, the Tuono 660 especially with the imu & quickshifter ticked, is also just over 10 grand. This Monster seems a better bet if only for an engine with 'character' (?). And the original Monster got the trellis because that was what the best Ducati sports bike of the day had, it wasn't designed as a retro, just became a bit of one by getting old. This reinvigorates the Monster."
1357,"I have fond memories of a certain Monster 1100 Evo with a set of Termi pipes under the tail. Took a demo ride on one of those back when they were still being made in that speck. 2nd gear throttle wheelies perfectly controllable, just roll on. Felt like a compact, well-handling Chevy V8 of grunt and sweet sound. Vibrated and shuttered a lot until you hit the magic RPM and everything smoothed right out. This 937 engine model I'd have to rip off the entire exhaust and find an system with big throated muffler producing deep barking sounds. It wouldn't be Ducati otherwise."
1358,"I had the old 821, and that was a nice bike indeed. A little to heavy perhaps for a middle bike. This bike is probably very nice to ride."
1359,I didn‚Äôt like the look at first. But when I went to Ducati dealer it looks way better than on pictures and it feels amazing. It actually make more sense to make the bike lighter and faster.
1360,"Great review. For me it's now, without the trellis frame, become just 'generic'......That's about as big an own goal as Ducati could score IMO."
1361,Nice review. I do like this bike but was a little put off & perplexed that it didn't have adjustable suspension. Seems an odd choice given the rest of the cycle parts are fairly premium.
1362,"Honest review that cuts through the noise. If it feels, sounds and runs like a Monster then I forgive the rest. Full disclosure; I own a dark stealth ‚Äò02 M750 so I can afford to be less critical about aesthetic evolution‚ÄîI‚Äôd call this new design, function over form. How very dare I say, un Italian üò≥ This clip is Designer approved ‚úÖ"
1363,"Excellent, mature, no nonsense review that covers all the bases. I‚Äôve had 3 air-cooled Monsters, but they lost me when they went water-cooled and the pipe-work was just really ugly. I now have a Street Triple 675 which I‚Äôm ready to replace. This is an interesting option, but possibly too low power, for similar money as a Street Triple 765 RS with Ohlins etc. The cornering ABS is a win here though. Also, I suspect like all ‚Äòbaby‚Äô Ducatis, including V2, it won‚Äôt have paint lacquer, so paint will just rub off - which is ridiculous."
1364,the fact you compared it to the unique Ducati feel and character to the older air cooled models. That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôve been looking for.
1365,I love the front faired-in indicators üëç
1366,"With the standard seat height being a bit high and all that ground clearance, they could have added an inch more of suspension travel to make it more compliant on the many badly maintained roads."
1367,Look at that ground clearance... I know it‚Äôll never see off-road but there‚Äôs just something I love about that.
1368,"Non adjustable suspension, non removeable passenger pegs means the 765 RS and 890r still beat it in this class."
1369,Suspension is SO FUCKING IMPORTANT. I could never buy another bike without fully adjustable suspension. Riding a motorcycle without adjustable suspension is like wearing someone else's pants.
1370,"Gorgeous bike....I've been on sport bikes for 25 years and have recently switched to the nakeds because of a bad back, I wish I had made the switch a long time ago."
1371,"I really like the front indicators be nice to see it with a factory belly pan , optional extra maybe ?"
1372,Headlight just doesnt work for me. I had a Ducati S2R 1000 and i covered over 50k on that bike. Absolutely brilliant. The 1200R is the one to have now
1373,"Funnily enough I have never been much of a fan of the looks of the Monsters, but I really like the more modern styling. Great review as always by the way."
1374,"I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a fabulous motorcycle but it comes off so sterile, plain and uninspired. The engine is all but invisible within the chassis and the frame offers zero ‚ÄúCome hither and ride yon‚Äù All bikes perform now, when I‚Äôm looking at a Ducati I want to feel like I‚Äôm cheating on my BMW if I ride it. I wanted a mistress and they made a wife."
1375,personally though I equate a Monster with a big Round tank. Kinda not into this model..
1376,great review as always mate . but will stick with my 796 ... i do think though if and when they get round to making a baby street fighter that could kill off the monster 
1377,Not loving the tank shape. I wish they'd kept the smooth lines from before. I understand the trellis frame being gone as an improvement (even though it will be missed).
1378,Its a shame it looks like a Chinese market drop out
1379,I‚Äôm thinking of getting a 2022 modell now!
1380,"I‚Äôd pick the 2021 MT09SP over all the bikes mentioned in this review. It‚Äôs super fun, handles superbly and is going to be more reliable than most"
1381,Excellent this incarnation for me is the best lookin Monsters made never really liked the look of the others ( each to their own ) but this one yes I would have one if I had that sort of money for a toy : )
1382,"I don't ""feel"" this bike. My impression is that 1100 Evo is best Monster ever. A theater on two wheels."
1383,"Looks a lot and sounds a little like my CFMoto NK650, only better in most ways. Lighter, more power, sharper, updated etc. At least I have the same ECU ü§£"
1384,Looks good. Just needs Gold colour wheels üòé
1385,This could have been a street triple killer. But they skimped on suspension and brakes. Perhaps an S model might make it a worthy competitor?
1386,Anyone know anything about when and if the 1200 will get updated? I was surprised when news of this bike dropped that the big brother didn‚Äôt get overhauled as well.
1387,Love the looks
1388,"this Monster, whether we like it or not, Ducatis are all about the looks and unfortunately this one does not impress at all, it genuinely looks like a CF Moto or any lambda Chinese manufacturer's copy of a Monster. Riding wise I haven't had the pleasure yet but it can't possibly be better than the competition (890, Striple RS etc), so where does this bike trump the others now ? Cause at least before it looked hella good."
1389,"Not for me, happy with my 797+ air cooled, trellis frame, what the Monster should be."
1390,"like the Panigale style half frame, but he must have missed the previous Monsters which had exact this design but a trellis solution instead of a cost reducing measure as is found on this newest iteration of the Monster, cast alu frame. I am pretty sure the new cast alu frame would fit almost straight on the older middle Monster."
1391,I think its not look like a monster at all
1392,I do love the fact that this is a v twin and not a boring parallel twin.
1393,"An honest review. As an owner of the first generation trellis frame (monster 695 2006) I must say, firstly I was dissappinted of Ducati dropping the trellis blah blah blah... but the weight loss, the power, the electronics etc. makes it a perfect streets bike. I mean autoturn off turning signals?? Wtf :))) me and my friends were always ‚Äúfantasizing/joking‚Äù about that:D come on: 166kg dry weight, 937cc, 111hp, 93nm at 6500, 30.000km desmo service interval. For that price? Solid naked bike from Ducati. Needless to say, nobody said sh!t about the streetfighter V4 not having a trellis frame also:D when it came out, no one mentioned it once!!:D Peace from Slovakia"
1394,"yes, agree, too many pipes and wires, someone through the italian design flair out the window"
1395,I'll miss the old look a lot
1396,"They should have reworked the trellis frame to something lighter, and made two Monsters for 2022. The Monster would be a 1400CC Superduke beater, and then they could have the Monster Junior, which would be this bike."
1397,When he tested the SP he had a grin a mile wide and raved about it. With the new monster it seemed like he was being polite and trying hard to find something good to say about it
1398,"Chris is great... but that just isn't a Monster, honestly I couldn't care less about the trellis frame, things move on. But, just look at it, way too much plastic, way too generic, just looks like it's been built to a budget and dare I say it an Asian market where Ducati (and other brands) are trying their hardest to tap into."
1399,So tired of retro and more retro. Modern monster.
1400,I never would have considered a Monster until I saw this one.
1401,"Have they not also dumped the desmo valves ?? SO they've dumped the 2 main things that always ""said"" Ducati"
1402,"I think styling would be the biggest split there and I‚Äôm a sucker for a Supermoto. On the road it depends how you like to ride - the Monster is better at flowing down a twisty road, the Hypermotard loves it when you‚Äôre hard on the brakes and punchy with the throttle."
1403,"Meh... replace the red for metallic blue, put a Yamaha badge on it and by all appearances - a Yamaha. If it doesn't look like a Monster, don't call it that. Retire the namesake if it forced to evolve beyond recognition, or shoehorn 21st century compliance into its iconic aesthetic."
1404,"This looks like a mistake from Ducati, a monsterous mistake !"
1405,"This is not a Monster. It's a weird Yamaha - MV Agusta hybrid abomination. Audi, erm, sorry, Ducati has managed to ungraciously kill an icon, a legend under the guise of ""moving forward/evolution"" bla bla all that empty marketing crap. Move forward with your sports bikes. People buy Monsters because they want to own a classic piece of history, not a pointless design masturbation üôèüèªüíü"
1406,I've seen it up close and I must say it's not very pleasing to the eye: plastic plastic and more plastic. Considering the aspect of attention to detail this Monster gets owned by a Street Triple R/RS PS: I'm Italian
1407,"I own one, I can confirm that it is indeed not a monster anymore. Let's forget about the trellis frame because it is what it is. This monster feels very cheaply made, the fit and finish is garbage, its got a plastic shell around the tank. You sit noticeably higher which is not the way monsters have been. It sounds like garbage with the OEM exhaust which is partially due to exhaust laws in the US and the UK but even with those laws having been around for a while the 821 still sounded good with factory exhaust. The only thing that this thing has in common with previous monsters is the badging and the fact that it feels like it wants to kill you, but then again cheaper bikes from yamaha, kawasaki, and honda offer that same feeling with much cheaper maintenance."
1408,It does look a lot less Monster and a lot more YamaSuki. Maybe Ducati really loves Japanese looks?
1409,"well, if it were made by Kawaski, I would buy it without hesitation!"
1410,It does have very nice Nippon looks.üëç Doesn't look like a Ducati at all.
1411,I will buy one for myself
1412,"Its a very cool bike, 4 me its just not a monster. If there wasnt the ducati logo, it could be an asian bike imo"
1413,"It looks 0% like a Monster, but whatever, it's probably a nice bike anyways. Plus, with that much clearence under the engine you could take it off roading."
1414,"Nah, the new monster is what a Japanese Ducati Monster would be. The Indian Ftr with high mount akro exhaust is the Ducati Monster Italy should have made"
1415,I miss old look but you are right
1416,It's pretty Performance is ok but nothing special Suspension works but nothing special There are better bikes in this class out there and also some not as good. How can I tell he didn't really care for this bike? It's in his tone and listening between the lines. Remember when he rode the ktm890 and his face was smiling and he said wow this is the best bike I ever rode. Now that's a positive review and this bike did not get that tone from him Overall you can tell he was careful to not bash it but he couldn't really find anything good about the bike except it's good looking which I agree. It is a pretty bike.
1417,so it's not a monster anymore i guess i probably will call this a ducati trickster
1418,Good thing it goes like a Ducati because those lines at the base of the fuel tank are awful. All scrunched up like it‚Äôs gone into a brick wall.
1419,"Call me old fashioned, but modern bikes are just getting uglier and uglier. I'm a huge air cooled Monster fan, from the first 900 to the last, even the 797. I even dig the early first water cooled models the S4R and S4RS. At least i could see what was going on behind the plumbing and lack of plastic. It was still simple. But this? WTF? Is it a previous gen MT09? Is it a Z900? Even an.older Z1000? Well to me, it dont even look like a Monster, let alone a Ducati. Ok, i can see it has 2 exhausts, so it must be a twin... But honestly, what a mess in the engine dept. Big fail in the looks dept Ducati, could never lift my garage door in the morning, looking fwd to seeing this monstrosity. Its a stylistic disaster."
1420,this new monster looks like it's designed by KTM designer. good looking though.
1421,"I am not a huge fan of trellis frames, most are ugly. But the monster always looked awesome with the trellis frame. I don‚Äôt think they should have ditched it for this model. This bike is not an all out sports competitor. And the monster made the trellis frame iconic."
1422,Should be mentioned Desmo valve maintenance is $$$$$$ and PIA. I dont understand why Ducati insists putting this complex tech on their bikes then have few techs within 200mile radius who can work on them...This reminds me of second gen and forward VFR series by Honda.The valve inspection alone is over 1200 dollars and most riders just dont do it....For this reasons I prefer Moto Guzzi BMW and some Japanese bikes easier to work on them.
1423,"I'd put the XSR900 in with the competition, spend a grand on suspension and it will still be cheaper, and whoop this thing in every dept, inc soul, character, sound, performance, and, most definetely, looks."
1424,"It‚Äôs clear he is trying to find something good to say for Ducati, knowing full well this thing is a turd. All I hear is him trying to justify this nightmare, downplaying things like the crappy suspension. No real honest review to be found, a joke but not surprised. Sporty really! does that look sporty to you all, just look at the ride position, it‚Äôs upright, no mention of the look and sound of the exhaust, that thing doesn‚Äôt look or sound like a monster. If you want a Mazde Miata, then this is your bike, nice work Ducati"
1425,First Ducati Changed the looks of Old Panigale and now the monster.. Gosh I'll miss them
1426,"Meh, I'll pass. Looks too much like a Hypermotard and, yes, I want a trellis frame for my Monster."
1427,They've gone so far down the wrong road with the Monster. Styled and watercooled into oblivion.
1428,"If you removed the Ducati badge and told me it was a Suzuki, I'd believe you. It looks nothing like a Ducati."
1429,Looks like a first generation MT09
1430,"Naah, without that trellis frame the view of the engine area looks messy."
1431,they've lost the plot completely..they should have called this bike something else. suzuki did brilliantly when they brought back the katana when they too screwed up the original with versions after
1432,Does remind my of the Honda CB
1433,"For a ducati, it looks awful! The tank looks like it's already had a head on crash and has bent and between the tank and sump it looks like it's been dipped in glue and random black plastic shapes have been thrown at it. I don't care how it rides, if I had to buy a monster I'd buy an old one."
1434,the bike's lost it's original characterüíî
1435,Looks like a Yamaha/Kawasaki naked. Kinda weak of Ducati to just copy the styling of the most popular bike of the moment...
1436,They had a Yamaha mt07 in the room when designing this bike
1437,"‚ÄúStill looks like a monster‚Äù Sorry mate, you need your eyes checked... if this bike looks like a monster, paint an mt07 red and it looks like a monster... And no, you can‚Äôt compare this to the trident, this bike‚Äôs triumph competitor is the street triple. "
1438,is that new MT07? oh.. guess it's ok.
1439,Ducati turned the Monster into another Japanese sport bike
1440,misson: sacrifice beauty vs weight. Accomplished.
1441,"More like Streetfighter V2(frame derived from Panigale V2, engine derived from SuperSport). The legendary Monster is dead, sadly. ** you Ducati"
1442,Not cheap for a Gladius.
1443,"Looks are subjective but it looks like a Chinese Copy of a Yamaha to me, it's no looker for a Ducati."
1444,its look like a yamaha fz rather than a monster
1445,"Doesn't look distinctive anymore ,you normally don't need to see the Ducati logo to know its a Ducati. You could easily mistake that for any Japanese naked not a bad thing but i want exotic looking if I'm buying Ducati."
1446,Like it but miss the trellis? --> Hypermotard 950
1447,At least they could have painted the frame red. It looks a little basic.
1448,"Its horrid, its like an old friend who's lost an eye in an accident. You just can't help staring at the empty socket and try and remember what they used to look like."
1449,i can't unsee that passenger footpeg bracket
1450,"No trellis frame. Just looks a bit 'generic' without it? If you stuck on a Yamaha badge, not sure you'd notice......"
1451,that radiator is way too exposed and the bike looks like new benelli 600i
1452,It is good enough for Suzuki SV- it is not a Ducati anymore....
1453,Looks too generic now.
1454,looks wise if i wanted a mvagusta i would go for the mvagusta. thumbs down ducati. but bike wise im sure its still plenty fun
1455,If only the exhaust sounds better
1456,Cross between a GSR750 and a KTM790. Not a compliment. Not a Ducati Monster. Should have called it something else.
1457,they've made this version look worse than all previous versions. It's now a no from me.
1458,Honda cb650r looks better
1459,Is this suzuki gladius?
1460,Looks like your run of the mill Honda. A bit dull for me.
1461,Ducati? all I see is a little Japanese bike
1462,It looks nothing like a Monster. Just take off the stickering and no one could guess.
1463,"First of all, this is not a Monster!"
1464,I dunno but to me the Monster has lost its sex appeal with this new design.
1465,Listening to this bike just makes me sad. I own a 2009/696 and it sounds like a roaring dragon while this one sounds like a mad kitty.
1466,the new engine has lost some growl.
1467,oh wow a red MT-07....
1468,"The side is bit Japanese, but the front is totally an MV agusta"
1469,A japanese mosters taste
1470,if you don't know that this bike is a Ducati i can put any badge you like and believe it .. that is a fail for a ducati bike
1471,why call it monster?- it isn't - its something else - monsters weren't naked superbikes
1472,"No no no, this doesn't look at all like a Ducati especially a Monster. That trelis frame was a signature hard to beat. If I would have done a blind test to guess which manufacturer is by the looks of the bike, would have lost big time. For me now it looks like a mainstream Japanese midweight naked."
1473,Still not drawn to its looks
1474,"Horribly ugly bike for a Monster, it looks Japanese. Great review dude though."
1475,No trellis= not a monster.
1476,"hopefully it's more reliable than the ktm, but then again it is a ducati..."
1477,"They destroyed the monster , it‚Äôs so ugly now"
1478,Not a Monster.
1479,Looks like an sv650.
1480,Sv650 is prettier from any angle!
1481,This looks like a cheap Chinese bike trying to look like a Ducati.
1482,"l m sure its rides just fine but it looks like new CRAP WHICH means too futuristic for a bike that look classic but ride new so to speak . l don t want to ride a space ship if l wanted that get a full on sport bike !! LEAVE THE NAKED BIKES ALONE !! ALL THE PLASTIC BITS MAKE IT LOOK MASS PRODUCED CRAP N CHEAP , l want my bikes to resemble to made by man not machines !!!"
1483,nice review of a fugly bike
1484,I'm still going for the Yamaha MT09 SP
1485,#NOTMYMONSTER
1486,I never liked the big ol round headlight.
1487,"Just looks like a Japanese bike and at that price point it needs to be a bit better looking, I'd take the 890R"
1488,"Worst looking monster. Looks like a Japanese bike. No originality that made the monster great, too refined. Thumbs down üëéüèΩ"
1489,Ducati made an ugly bike HA! they are human after all
1490,I'm a Ducati biker but I just cant like this look no matter how I try.. just looks like a boring Japanese bike..
1491,Dude this bike is so ugly say whatever u want idc.
1492,untight and the most ugliest Ducati ever made... previous Monster looks epic this new one looks too cheap
1493,personally I think the new sporty looks sweet
1494,"Yes, especially the trellis frame. That was the Monster's identity. But she got a point."
1495,"BS marketing Kool aid.. my Monster 1100 evo (awesome bike) was lighter WITH the trellis frame. Ditto for my current 890 Duke R with uses a tube steel frame and has a water cooled plant. How can the KTM be lighter, more powerful and still use steel? Simple... Ducati has lazy engineers that cut corners instead of properly designing a bike. They then shroud deficiencies with marketing mumbo jumbo the reviewers regurgitate enough times till it's perceived as true."
1496,"The monster has a special place in my heart as the bike that inspired me to get my license. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm a big fan of this new monster. My dad‚Äôs last bike before he stopped riding was a 2000 Monster 750 and we both agree that this seems to push the monster away from being it‚Äôs own unique beast into a more generic naked bike. It‚Äôs agree with your final decision of it ‚Äústill being a monster‚Äù but to me it seems like it‚Äôs that, but a little less of a monster than the one from last year, and that‚Äôs a shame to me"
1497,"I agree completely Ducati has the scrambler line for ""When you prioritize nostalgia and style over innovation"". I have and love my Trellis-riding air-cooled ducati, but they went as far as they could with that layout and it was a clear limitation."
1498,"I'm not sold on the Monster itself though. To me, Ducati is who you go to when you DON'T want to compromise between style and performance."
1499,The sounds of that bike make me want one!
1500,"There‚Äôs no getting left behind, this is a great all-rounder .. üëçüòä"
1501,The bike leaves alot to be desired
1502,I love Ducati's but I like the old Monster's better. My opinion only.
1503,". Seems like a fun bike, but I am still heavily biased towards the classic Monsters."
1504,"Ducati: ""We gotta be different"" Also Ducati: ""Let's make it look like everything else"""
1505,"110% with that last sentiment. Innovation and development > nostalgia and style Not an ugly bike at all either, gorgeous."
1506,"About the new Monster: ""Change"" is more-or-less in Ducati's DNA. That said, this ""new"" Monster probably rides fine, looks largely forgettable."
1507," Looks like a solid bike. But when you said that yes it's still a Monster, I didn't buy it and wasn't convinced that you do either. I get that Volkswagen/Ducati made the changes they did to comply with Euro 5 standards, but I wonder if it would have been better to rebrand it. Harley Davidson went through the same thing with their new Sportster. It's really not a Sportster anymore..."
1508,"I can live with loosing the trestle frame, but it is insane that they cover the motor in plastic!!"
1509,"I dont like losing the frame, but I get it. That tank and headlight are too far of a departure for me"
1510,"The monster was a styling exercise from the start, and this styling just isn't it. Looks like a generic modern middleweight. At least when they switched to testastretta engines the ugliness of the extra plumbing was matched by the extra performance. This model isn't significantly upping the performance ante and looks a lot cheaper than it is"
1511,I‚Äôll stick with the monster 821
1512,"Keeps the weight down. I just dont like the styling of them, the older look better"
1513,That's gonna look so good with a rear fender delete.
1514,"I like the new look a lot more, especially if it comes with new capabilities"
1515,Non adjustable suspension on a $12k bike is kind of ridiculous. It‚Äôs not a budget naked bike. I think a lot of the changes are a move in the right direction but it needs some better pogo sticks.
1516,"I could care less about a trellis frame, loved my 797 but want adjustable suspension and don‚Äôt want a 1200."
1517,"For the price, it‚Äôs very ridiculous. Drop the price by 2k and sure, that‚Äôs fine."
1518,"Not a fan of the new looks - with the lack of the iconic trellis frame, the narrow tank and oddly large amount of ground clearance, I can‚Äôt decide if I find it dull or weird. Probably a bit of both. On a positive note: it‚Äôs nice to see that Ducati have given it an engine that delivers this time around. The 821 engine certainly didn‚Äôt."
1519,I do like this bike but I'm not properly interested until they put some decent adjustable suspension on it. Do I need it? Probably not but for this price point I want & expect it. Until then no deal which is shame as I like the rest of the design a lot.
1520,Still a beautiful monsterüëç
1521,Guess I‚Äôll wait for a V2 version of the streetfighter to get my first Ducati
1522,"it looks modern and interesting, even though i miss the classic monster cues. Thats subjective. What isn't subjective is how Euro 5 makes almost every new bike sound like an flippin sewing machine, in many cases without a simple way to rectify That. If spent the premium for the new monster, i'd not be keen to spend 2K more to make my exhaust sound like a Ducati."
1523,"The monster, ruined. The trellis frame is a sad loss but maybe the new one is progress. But Covering that beautiful engine in plastic is just cheap. I guess he old model just became a collector classic."
1524,"I'm going to wait for the adjustable fork model hopefully in 2023? ( I have two 2007 Ducati monster S2R 800, probably will turn it into living room art =) )"
1525,"I think I would still choose the MT-09/MT-09SP over this. There is still that stigma around Ducati maintenance, and cost to own that for me doesn't make me want to own one."
1526,Same price category as KTM's Duke 890r.....not a hard choice for me. Even the MT09 has more character and bang for buck.
1527,"Definitely different but I like the look except for one major area. The engine. Having it cover by a fairing is one thing but with all that molded plastic, it doesn't look like it has a typical combustion engine, but more something like electric. Makes that area of the bike too futuristic imo."
1528,Makes for a really solid first bike you don‚Äôt need to upgrade for a long time. But then the price tag hits. That‚Äôs 1000 shy of an mt-10. Way too expensive.
1529,That's a beautiful monster.. quite literally
1530,I think I'd still rather have the old 1200s
1531,"I think Ducati lost its way on the current Monster. Too much tech, modern styling but still a solid review, especially if this is your first one"
1532,"Not a bad bike, great review (not all positive, thank you!), but if I wanted a Monster (and I do), I'd just get a used old one. Pass for me"
1533,"Just bought mine today, it‚Äôs like a Yamaha MT 07 on steroids with a much better suspension"
1534,"The Monster hasn't been the same since 2008 when the headlight got punched inwards. This one's just a symptom of that evolution away from the 1993-2007 styling. Hell even the displacement is vastly different. I don't think Ducati will go back the way Suzuki did, and that's fine. Makes me wanna buy the Suzuki instead."
1535,Reminds me of when Suzuki butchered the SV650 into the Gladius. And look what happened there‚Ä¶
1536,Wish it had an engine cowl. That would make it look even better
1537,"You can prioritize innovation and still make the bike look good. The bike just looks bad. It might be good to ride and have great innovative features and tech but it still looks bad. Setting aside the general complaint about trellis frame being gone, the headlight and tail section are just horrible, don't get how innovation required them to be so bad iooking."
1538,Brembos and quick shifter but non adjustable suspension... bit counter intuitive
1539,my dream bike!
1540,The Monster is what got me turned onto Ducati years ago. But I'm going to stay with my MT09 until the Monster gets its mojo back.
1541,"The Monster is no longer that, this is a completely different motorcycle in most cases and needs a new name to match those differences. RIP Monster."
1542,It's a Monster indeed
1543,I know style isn't everything but when there are so many awesome choices it makes the difference for me. My Monster 796 is a work of art and I have a unique bike everywhere I go which is awesome. I'm afraid to switch to any throttle by wire system now because the throttle feel is so visceral and awesome.
1544,Nice bike
1545,"before i even watch the video past the one minute mark: any vehicle that is euro 6 compliant or similar isnt a monster, sadly :("
1546,The previous monster was one of my favorite bikes across all categories‚Ä¶ this new version isn‚Äôt a consideration.
1547,"Nice video. I owned a monster 1200. Aesthetics are constantly changing on all makes. I like the looks. It is considerably lighter with new frame setup. Ducati is a premium manufacturer with status above Yamaha or Honda. Japanese bikes are on everywhere. If cash strapped go with the Japanese. If more cash in your pocket go with the adventure of exotica, Ducati."
1548,"I own one, I can confirm that it is indeed not a monster anymore. Let's forget about the trellis frame because it is what it is. This monster feels very cheaply made, the fit and finish is garbage, its got a plastic shell around the tank. You sit noticeably higher which is not the way monsters have been. It sounds like garbage with the OEM exhaust which is partially due to exhaust laws in the US and the UK but even with those laws having been around for a while the 821 still sounded good with factory exhaust. The only thing that this thing has in common with previous monsters is the badging and the fact that it feels like it wants to kill you, but then again cheaper bikes from yamaha, kawasaki, and honda offer that same feeling with much cheaper maintenance."
1549,"Once I heard the front suspension has no adjustability, that was a disappointment from Ducati. At almost $12,000, MT-09 or MT-10 offers adjustable forks."
1550,Bikes super fun to ride but it cooks your nuts where the exhaust comes under the seat. Super hot.
1551,"It‚Äôs tough leaving the beautiful trellis frame. Ducati is known for both, performance and looks."
1552,Well I‚Äôm mad about the bike 
1553,The old air/oil Monsters ..loud and proud. The new gens are not as exciting..IMO
1554,"I'm the only one who wants that ground clearance on every bike. This is one that bike I'd ride around the world without ever wishing for an ADV. But it's a Ducati, I will wish for a mechanic who has specialized tools."
1555,expensive but with SCOOTER SOUND.. üò≠
1556,Huh here we get a inline 4 that too for less ....why the hell anyone would buy this...Ducati needs to improve in its pricing..
1557,It's a red mt07. I mean I get why they ditched the trellis frame but it's so bland looking
1558,"Not only the trellis frame is gone, but the engine looks like a mess of black plastic. Besides, this isn't the entry level Ducati anymore, that's the scramblers now. This is like an mt09 or z900 with EXPENSIVE valve checks"
1559,"I‚Äôm sorry, but innovation? What does this bike bring new to the market? Absolute nothing it‚Äôs just playing catch up to existing bikes. 821/1200 actually had some innovations. Engine as a stressed member of the chassis, multi stage ABS and TC, top of the line Brembo brakes. Almost no naked bike were up to that spec in 2014. This new Monster has nothing new, they just changed the frame (aluminum frames have been for decades, no innovation) and fit the 7 years old Ducati 821 brakes and electronics from 1200s. Oh, and made it it look like that... lol You buy Ducati with your heart, but seems like you‚Äôre asking to buy with your brain, and your brain say you should buy a 890R or a street tripleRS... More power, fully adjustable suspension, better brakes, etc. I hate this attitude that a bike has to be ugly to be any good, ridiculous. Oh and this bike has no problem, they could have introduced it as a ""streetfigghter 950"" and nobody would be mad. The problem is that they killed a 30 year old heritage to introduce this thing, that isn't even a stand out in it's segment, totally average bike."
1560,Not single sided swingarm means its a cheaper ducati
1561,Good Lord they messed this bike up royally!!!! It looks like something fell off the front of it...
1562,I have an Aprilia and the trellis frame is part of the appearance it‚Äôs one of the main parts you see when you look at the bike. This new Monster looks like they forgot to ship half of a bike ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I put this model and last years model up on 2 displays side by side and said to my wife and daughter which looks best ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they both picked last years model and they know little about motorcycles üò≥üò≥
1563,Kind of SV 650 like don't you think? Poor Ol' Ducati what ever happened? It's now just another UJM only it's not supposed to be. I see a soulless machine toned down by Euro 5 BS to the point that even a E motorcycle might be sexier. Ouch!
1564,"If Jen would be italian, she would understand why there is a launch mode. :D The MT-09 is a far better bang for the buck with fully adjustable suspension."
1565,"As an owner of multiple Ducati's, the thing many people seem to forget is that the Monster was always about style; it was never a performance bike (except briefly as the S4.) I think the mistake here for Ducati is they should have called this a Streetfighter, as they already have that model line, and continued on with a bike that carried on the Monster heritage. And if they didn't see the sales numbers, give the model name a break for a while, then introduce a new Monster later to great fanfare. To me, this is just using the model name to trade on their own history, while simultaneously neglecting it."
1566,A first generation Versys with all the plastics removed.... Would be much cheaper and way more dynamic. ~ Yet looks about the same.
1567,"That is too bad. The monster is dead. No, it is not a monster. I am surprised Ducati is following other companies when it comes to image. In my opinion Ducati was the leader in sexy looking bikes. The original monster had an image that deserved the name. You can usually spot a Ducati from miles away. Going to need to stop next to this one at a light and checkout the label."
1568,really how is Ducati not getting the snot sued out of them by mv Agusta. that shaped droopy headlight with the lighted ring is like mvs main thing they have been doing for years.
1569,Looks like a Yamaha mt0 something
1570,"I don't care much about the bike to be honest, feel like it's lost it's soul."
1571,"What the hell happened to the Beautiful Sexy Monster! Ducati, you totally F...ed up!!!"
1572,"Took the fairings off to make a naked bike, then put a dozen tiny fairings back on to make...a half-naked bike?"
1573,Telescopic fork and non adjustable? That yikes for me dawg
1574,"yeah, innovation done right is good, innovation for the sake of it ... no tnx"
1575,"Ducati ruined the new Monster, it looks like a Yamaha now. Looks like I will be holding onto my 2015 Monster 821 for a while longer."
1576,"Hey, there‚Äôs that MV Augusta Brutale they ripped off‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶"
1577,"Looks wise , another yawn bike...just like the speed triple 1200 RS..... ü•±"
1578,Looks Japanese... Not a classic Ducati Monster look.
1579,No...ducati messed up with the design ...old design was much better...the only change needed was in headlamp..from halogen to led....other than that this bike needed no change in design...I hate what they did with the design of my favourite moster...
1580,"If this bike was a woman it would be Holly Holm. Aggressive, packs a punch, got a few tricks but still classy. Love it!"
1581,"encase the engine in boring plastic? üëÄ people I know who bought Ducatis got them for style not practicality. Sounds like a bad idea to me but maybe they are like Harley and are trying to appeal to younger people, idk üòÖ sure hope it looks better in person üòÖ"
1582,"makes no sense to me, other bikes didn't wrap their engines in ugly plastic and passed Euro5 ü§î mt10, Indian scout, Harley PanAm, Bmw 1250GS etc ü§î"
1583,damn thing looks like a chinese knock off ducati
1584,Looks like a Yamaha MT09. They fucked up here in my opinion. 12k is cheap for a new Ducati monster. The old one sale for 9k
1585,I owned a monster 796 this new monster look like shit compare to mine
1586,All that electronics takes away thinking
1587,It looks so... generic.
1588,"All I'm gonna say about the Monster is, my 200cc bike from India sounds exactly the same and to me that's kinda lame"
1589,"The looks WERE what made it a Monster though Change all that, cover it in cheap plastic and it's just a nekkid Ducati (only just) and thus blends in with everything else cheap and Chinese looking Nah, no longer for me"
1590,"I always loved the look of the Ducati Mosters, but this look sucks. Where the signature rails shit at?"
1591,Def NOT a Monster. Where's the innovation again? I didn't see it past the ugliness of this bike.
1592,They ruined it
1593,Im italian and I will never spend 12k for a monster I will go with kawasaki z900 or suzuki gsxs 750 and save 4k
1594,Slap a Suzuki sticker on it and no one would know. It's that generic.
1595,"Si boring looking,"
1596,Boo ducati ya made the monster ugly
1597,Nice Honda
1598,Its not Ducati anymore... because doesnt have signature trelis frame and single sided swingarm
1599,Fugly. Fire the team who made this....
1600,This Monster has become a starter bike in my opinion.
1601,That ain't no monster.
1602,ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
1603,"This bike has lost what it was. Now it's just another naked. Not a Ducati anymore. And for the price, I'll take the Street Triple RS. Or the MT09 SP. Or a bunch of other bikes. "
1604,This monster is feminine !!
1605,"Still a Monster, but no the best looking one."
1606,Not a monster.
1607,How are the brakes on the SP model?  A bit wooden but plenty of power
1608,"What do you think about Yamaha mt10 and Yamaha mt10 sp this two which one is good for money ? I've had both, imo if you are buying one go for the sp, if you already have an mt-10 the sp isn't leaps and bounds better but it's nice to have the fancy bits."
1609,its a really easy bike to ride ... and if nescessary u have electronics to help u out
1610,"The r6 has such a crazy power curve, whilst the mt10 has much more power, but a flatter curve"
1611,"I hate the looks of the mt 10, mt09 is so much better looking tbh"
1612,I ordered the 2022 sp first time in the US..the bike is truly a beast..can't wait..
1613,Nice bike way too pricey
1614,"I bought my MT-10 when I was 24, it was the bike of my dreams! Since then I can no longer separate myself from it! On the other hand, I much prefer mine aesthetically. ‚úå"
1615,"At Yamaha, they managed to do even more ugly than my MT-09 üòÑ Completely agree with you, I'm 65 years old and their color choices I don't understand ü§î What made me choose the new 09? is its price / fun ratio and if I had them the rounds I would also have chosen this MT-10 as you say for its great engine and its beautiful music. ‚ù§"
1616,"Hi guys, 18000 Kms with my 10 SP of AssholesüòÇ, for nothing in the world I won't change a real crush on this wheel.‚ù§Ô∏è"
1617,"The MTs sell so much because the quality, fun price ratio is just great. The mt09 SP will be my future motorcycle, not for its finish which sucks but the reliability, top engine, and equipment present for a reasonable price compared to the competition. Great try anyway ‚úåÔ∏è"
1618,"I am a fan and owner of a Tuono V4, I preferred it to the MT10"
1619,"The definition of an asshole motorcycle suits me well üëçüòÅ, I did 10,000 km with mine ü§©ü§™ Ugliness is very overrated ü§£‚úåÔ∏è I'm 56 years old and I'm having fun with my MT 10 SP"
1620,"The comparison to be made is with the tuono V4, the speed triple rs and the streetfighter V2, the best engines possible!"
1621,"I had both, the mt10 takes control more quickly than the zh2, anyone will have fun quickly on its handlebars. On the Zh2 it has to be earned, in one try you don't realize the potential of the bike. It takes a few kilometers to get used to the acceleration of the bike and the force that the supercharging gives, once you have passed this milestone you will find a very fun machine, healthy, stable, good braker, very efficient and permissive electronics and quite comfortable. Objectively the zh2 outperforms the mt10 (2017 model) on all points, but I haven't tested the new one."
1622,I know the old model very well and this bike is a pure delight.
1623,"really a shame, in SP model it would have me much more, but the autonomy is really too penalizing."
1624,"Yes basically the max I managed to do is 230km (lots of highway, a little regulator etc) And in arsouille it's more like 180km max (with 17 liters of tank). On track it was 140, 160km. The driving modes also contribute quite a bit."
1625,Just like the MT09 (which I own) the more I look at it the more I find this MT10 attractive. She looks mean!!! But too expensive and above all much too powerful for my level of leek. I'm already scared enough with the MT09.
1626,"I'm 36 years old and I like yamaha but I recognize that the design of MTs we like we don't like... Well, I don't like ü§¢ (except the small MTs) On the other hand, in terms of sensations, I should test the monster ‚úå üèª"
1627,"Superb :) It must be something to ride with that! But hey, I want to keep my license! Besides, I don't understand this horse race that manufacturers are engaged in ..... 165 for 210 kg?? Gotta stop it! We are on the road not on tracks!"
1628,"Personally I bought a 1290 Superduke R at 23, so an equivalent of MT-10. I don't think it's for 35+"
1629,"I love the MT10... I'm 51 years old. When the colors, I don't give a damn... What is the most beautiful view of Paris? The one from the top of the Montparnasse tower.... When you're on it, you can't see it.‚úåüèº"
1630,"I am 49 years old and I find it not bad. And I find the BMW gs, the new suzuki gsx, the new BMW roadster horrible and I don't like the headlights of the new speed. Each his own"
1631,I'm a fan of yam... but I admit they messed up üòÖ first generations I validate but fluo and that's impossible to buy without customization directly in the budget ü§∑üèæ ‚ôÇÔ∏èü§ó
1632,"I am the same age as you. I ride an MT-09, you're right it's already too much with my 119cv I'm doing the flag üòä but what's cool is that for the first time in my life I finally found the bike that has such a potato that you no longer need to buy another two years later. That's the advantage of having it under the foot (well under the right hand) ‚úå"
1633,"Even if I haven't been a Roadster since the 90s, I find the front face very nice üëç on the other hand, too bad it's still a ""4 legs"" üòï"
1634,"Me ugly and mean ü§ñüëπ It's the party of colors...üò≥ü§î Personally, I so much prefer a thruxton or speed triple too! ‚úåÔ∏è"
1635,The beast becomes the beauty!! üòâ
1636,"everyone finds it very ugly, it's crazy anyway xD I much prefer to buy an old second-hand than the new model."
1637,the 09 is the ugliest by far. Not to mention the finishes which are atrocious.
1638,"personally the 09 does not disgust me that much compared to the 10, but yes, the finishes suck ...."
1639,the old mt 10 is prettier all the same.
1640,"I'm 29, waiting for her to be available for trial. I also find it very ugly. I tried an S1000R, which is much prettier and just as fun and powerful. But we are quickly at 19k‚Ç¨ with a few options at BMW"
1641,"214 kilos is not much...? From my point of view it is an elephant. at 15,000 a piece I would prefer a lighter bike, especially since it can be used on the track."
1642,"Even if the Tuono is above, we must not forget that the cycle part of the MT-10 comes from that of the R1 üòâ Believe me in terms of handling it is a rail, but it is not cut for the track like for tuono."
1643,MT is not made for virolos but for wheelies. Incomparable with the Tuono üòâ
1644,I'm 31 and I don't like it at all‚Ä¶ After that I'm not going to say anything because I drive a 1290 superduke v3 orange üçä üòÇ
1645,"Autobot , transformation !"
1646,how ugly is she! it is less flexible than a Fazer 1000 Fzs with carbs.
1647,BMW S1000R forever .......
1648,Apparently I'm the only one who really likes the looküòÑ
1649,Another motorcycle that is useless on the road ..
1650,As much as the old one I found her pretty with her style as much as she is horrible...
1651,I don't think there's much of a difference in looks. From previous models
1652,"It's true, I also liked the lighthouse of the old ones better."
1653,would have been very interesting to see whether Yamaha got the absurdly high fuel consumption of the predecessor under control?
1654,"Unfortunately, the horn problem runs through the whole MT series... they even didn't spare the new XSR 900 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1655,the mask is very bulky. And sits way too high.
1656,The video is good but the bike is a huge disappointment. Visually a disaster
1657,"I think the display and the additional electronics are great. What I don't like is that you can see the horn and handlebar damper from the front. The revised rear also looks good, why they then grow such giant turn signals is a mystery to me. (The accessory trade is happy) But what are the screw holes on the side of the frame for???"
1658,"The most consistent component at Yamaha is definitely the horn, it was on my XS400 back in 1980 üôÇ"
1659,"Brilliant bike, looks great and works great. But if I had to choose, I would choose the new Suzuki, it drives so well and looks cool too."
1660,How (bad) is the fuel consumption? (It used to be dramatic for the old one)
1661,"For me, Yamaha builds the hottest engine concepts...unfortunately, the design department drank paint years ago...so that the new bikes are all unpurchasable for me...unfortunately. The exception for me is the new xsr900 ... which is also visually successful. It's a matter of taste and you can always argue about that, but very few of the new models at Yamaha are good for me. Again - exception xsr900 .. I find it divine"
1662,"if yamaha had kept the rn43 mask/built it on all machines, the design would all be great"
1663,yamaha meanwhile unbuyable from the design except r1 i'm honest
1664,"I see it the same way, actually wanted to buy the new MT10 but optically they just screwed it up, so it turned out to be something different."
1665,"I agree with you 100% there. Absolutely terrible, their design in recent years. I suspect they could double their sales worldwide if they hired even one Italian designer. Even with the (actually very successful) new XSR they had to screw on this funny giant hump, it makes you cry. After all, it's only the seat, that can be fixed."
1666,"Waited a long time for it. What was good is as good or better, there are a few extras that were missing but they just couldn't resist the front end. You just have to drive them nice and/or drink nice. Sound, especially with Akra, is divine for that."
1667,"I find the optics, like apparently most here, not so intoxicating. But the bike itself is even more so. Preferably in the SP version."
1668,She doesn't suit my taste. I also prefer V engines. a matter of taste. can be discussed forever. But find the feedback read the dealers and salespeople Vlt.
1669,I'm very satisfied with my rn45 and don't expect anything else from the new one.
1670,I think it's great when bikes look extraordinary. Cool part!
1671,"If it weren't for the optics, I would genuinely consider the machine. But unfortunately Super Duke and Streetfighter are hotter üòÖ"
1672,"It's kinda too expensive for all that plastic stuff. I'd rather take the KTM for less money, where you can at least still see the engine üòÖ In addition, the engine is said to work quite boringly linear."
1673,"the Petronas Yamaha MotoGP team that existed until last year. In my opinion, that was the most beautiful livery in the GP, but unfortunately I don't like the design of the MT-10 at all."
1674,"Good shot, but again I don't like the mask"
1675,Awesome bike with an ingenious motor! Will haveüôèüôèüôè‚ù£Ô∏è
1676,"Certainly a great motorcycle... Looks are always a matter of taste...even if you like the mask, nobody will find a low beam that shines on one side great. Don't understand why many big manufacturers still don't get it baked in 2022 that both headlights light up....always looks like one light went out. With older motorcycles there was still the argument about energy consumption... but that was in the days of halogen..."
1677,"Yamaha motorcycle design disappoints me consistently and sadly in this case too. From my point of view, this model has at least tended to get a prettier ""face"" than the previous model with the ""bulb eyes"" due to the daytime running light strips and small windshield, but that's about it. Everything about the machine seems extremely untidy to me. There is also an ugly license plate holder, the exposed junk including the horn under the light mask and much more. No, this is another model from Yamaha, which visually repels me rather than positively irritates me. And a consumption of around 7 l per 100 km is for me - for example in the In view of the current fuel prices - no reason to cheer and will not be an argument to praise or defend such a vehicle as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the car."
1678,I think the old Mt 10 looks better.
1679,"Lol a ""new"" display must be old stock displays from the pre-gen Tracer 9. PS: 1000hp, you do the best video recording while riding, but if you're standing next to the bike and talking about the seating position, why are you sitting don't get on your bike straight away to show the spectators how you're sitting?"
1680,What really bothered me about the predecessor was the brakes. I always got a fright when braking hard in the corners. Hope the new one is better!
1681,"I suspect that the old and the new MT-10 were developed and primarily ""designed"" by an emergency team during the company holidays (you can see the unusable positioning of the passenger footrests and the ""attachment"" of the horn, among other things). One could at least have waited until at least one designer returned from vacation."
1682,"So no idea how it drives But optically .... Well, let's put it that way , it's not mine, neither the color combo nor the shape / the design .... But good tastes differ"
1683,"This sure is a good and fun big bike. Unfortunately I don't like the design of the newer Yamahas at all, even the XSR900 the designers completely screwed up. The display is already a bit too small in this class and the consumption of the CP4 is probably still far too high. The last beautiful naked bike was the XJR1300 in the last version."
1684,Top ü§©
1685,Rim color extra nice
1686,Certainly a super moped but it looks too much like a craft booth to me.
1687,"It's a cool thing, but Yamaha already stated a consumption of 8 l/100 km for the previous model - at ‚Ç¨2.15 (Germany today) per liter you should be pretty pain-free. The season hasn't even really started yet, and I would have to pay more than 40(!) euros for a full tank - for the motorcycle. You really shouldn't have any other obligations.."
1688,I wonder how many inexperienced people point out that a headlight is broken.
1689,"Unfortunately not quite enough ramblings, dear Vauli. Because I'm sure many MT-10 owners would be interested to know whether the new one drinks as much as the old one. I can only hope that Yamaha turned it around, not just because of the current perverse fuel prices."
1690,Reminds me of petronas yamaha team from motogp I like the green
1691,It's good that tastes are different. But I don't like cyan at all and this gray is more reminiscent of rust protection
1692,At least not a cyclopean eye like 7 and 9 üòÑ
1693,Brutally cool moped üëçüèªü•≥
1694,"The design is just bad, Yamaha just can't design many bikes, partly also cheap impression. Triumph is a different world there, optics, haptics, etc. 4-year guarantee and things are now just as good as the Japanese."
1695,"Yamaha also has a 4-year guarantee in Switzerland from 2022. I wouldn't be so optimistic about Triumph's durability, for example there's a lot to read about the engine in the Street Triple 765 RS. A colleague's is more reminiscent of a 2-stroke engine in terms of oil consumption. My 2017 MT 10 now has 95,000 km, 5,000 of which are on the racetrack. I can't report much about defects. During the test at the road traffic office, the first brake discs were still installed at the front. That's quality. PS: on the track I use dual carbon pads from SBS that are relatively gentle on the disc."
1696,Looks a bit like a Triumph from the front
1697,The consumption have not improved!
1698,"The designers at Yamaha for the MT series must be really sick transformer fetishists. The front originally looks like one of those evil little Transformers. Awesome bike but because of the look, the MT series is really no longer buyable for me."
1699,The horn reminds me of the MT 09 because it was attached without any thought.
1700,"Clutch lever still not adjustable and definitely as stiff as the previous model (I had it).... not good at all, I don't understand it.... Engine CP4 is of course great to drive... my fuel consumption was 8.5 ltr"
1701,"Shapeless, chubby thing - and that doesn't mean the Vauli at all. The first model series was initially quite interesting because it was very bold. However, you quickly got fed up with it. All the technical features should be up to date, only the consumption could remain an issue. Overall just bad, Yamaha."
1702,It will be a good 8 liters
1703,The light looks like it was stolen from a Triumph
1704,"The color is nice, something different. But the light mask ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...reminds me a bit of Triumph. But there will certainly be buyers for this as well. Apparently she drives well, and that is of course also an important argument üòâ"
1705,Technically top...but optics are a flop for me...you have to like it. I don't.
1706,Am I the only one who thinks the daytime running lights look like the Nissan Juke or Qashqai? üòÑ
1707,Who actually cares about the display? You only look at it in the village so that you don't crash through at 80. And every 100 km to check if you need to fill up.
1708,The wind protection that distinguished the MT10 is gone. At least visually. Serious design flaw. The color display doesn't help either.
1709,I have the old 10 and I have to say that the new one doesn't appeal to me at all. The front looks as intended and not skillfully.
1710,Looks like the evil Gremlin
1711,Unpopular opinion of mine: really ugly thing
1712,this optics is a scandal .... the last beautiful one was the Fz1 ......
1713,Visually not mine at all
1714,Light mask is ugly again
1715,please not with this rim color 
1716,And I wanted to get the SP and I was annoyed that they are only available in blue and not with this awesome rim color.
1717,The SP with the blue rims and the golden fork is really sharp
1718,it's a cool moped! The choice of colors is awesome. The front optics are awesome. But the video makes me feel a little stressed. Tsch√ºll amol Olta :-) You can really tell that you don't like the moped. Just go to other manufacturers.
1719,"I'll never get along with the asymmetrically glowing Gschau, it doesn't matter which bike. There will be a good reason for that, at least I hope so."
1720,My god the box is ugly.
1721,"I can't believe how everyone focuses on the design... Just like the first water-cooled 911 Porsche. Everyone has concentrated on the headlights üôâ A salad has to be good, but the flowers have to be beautiful, because they can't be used for anything else. Don't be so overperfumed‚ùó"
1722,My dream motorbike is MT 10
1723,MT is really tempting.
1724,Bumblebee version of Yamaha üî•
1725,Just realized what the swingarm looks like with the Yamaha R1em
1726,"It's very complete, the ripiw is so cool üëçüëçüëç"
1727,Crossplanes are awesome...
1728,dream motorbike....
1729,This is just optimum pride
1730,MT 10 SP idaman dream motorbike
1731,"it's a crossplane, the sound is still different from in line/v4"
1732,"I've always liked watching MT-10, it's scary"
1733,THE MACHINE IS THE SAME AS R1
1734,"The look is really fierce, but the sound is still melodious the cbr650r"
1735,The dream of all men
1736,Sounds like a Ducati 2 cylinder maybe because of the crossplane?
1737,The crossplane engine is really cool
1738,The sound of the engine is almost like the RSV4
1739,Savory voice
1740,"Obviously MT, maintenance is not as expensive as v4"
1741,"Great great bike, I had 2016 for a season and I still regret it so much, I can only imagine this evolution ... pity only for the aesthetics of the lighthouse I don't like unfortunately but like on the whole mt range of 2022 üòî"
1742,"All nice, I had the 2018 and the subtleties that the 2022 has, such as brakes and electronics, were missing but they managed to make it uglier than before üòÇüòÇ"
1743,"I am very sorry that Yamaha has distorted its headlight design so much ... I know that we need to innovate and that lately the bulky headlights are not the most popular, on the contrary, but how characteristic and ""bad"" were the elongated headlights? I am reminded of the sharp gaze of the Fazer 1000 or 800, gorgeous. Right now, unfortunately, they don't inspire me at all and it's really a shame. Personally I would very much like to buy a Tracer9 but despite the improvements even at the same expense I would choose the 2020 model for a purely aesthetic matter, the new nose seems disproportionate to me, as if it had a ""tiny head"" with two even smaller ""eyes"". ... in short, not the best, not to mention the new MT-07 and 09, whose optical group seems to come out of a sci-fi Z series film, of those in which the strange and the meaningless equate to futuristic, with that ball in the center whose only reason for existing is to make the bike recognizable (and this is not always a good thing). Obviously, aesthetics is a personal and subjective discourse, so I am aware that many will be able to appreciate this new path, but I will continue to hope for a return of the elongated double headlight."
1744,"..big engine, a little Mazinger look, and color combinations .. unacceptable ..üò¨"
1745,The drl reminds me of the eyebrows of an old Japanese monk of those who move a finger and make a massacre.
1746,"The technical contents seem valid, but I can't digest this new stylistic course from Yamaha ... those eyebrows that have introduced a bit across the range do anyone really like them? And those elements obviously out of place, such as the off-set horn and in plain sight under the headlight assembly, could not have been better studied?"
1747,I have not yet heard of anyone who aesthetically like the new Yamaha front üòÖ
1748,"Why don't we talk about that horrendous clutch cable that seems to have been left hanging? Bah. Front 100 times more beautiful than that of the old mt10, even if many didn't like that either"
1749,the bike is beautiful 
1750,"Great bike to ride but impossible to watch, like the whole MT series ... what a great pity! A little more decent than the previous one, but there are other beautiful bikes."
1751,"Not bad in general. I find the lighthouse pleasant, I think the position is really wrong, it must have been lower."
1752,I'm sorry it's designed in Italy because I still don't like it. She always seems to be missing a piece to be ok.
1753,All wonderful until you open your eyes and realize that it is as bad as debt !!! Among the insiders in the sector they already call it the ugly duckling !!!
1754,"Nice bike for geeks, long ago had a pair of naked ... they have fun but are limited in many things, unfortunately still now they don't like the aesthetics .... as is the small and the medium, beauty is subjective, the price is absurd, bikes that shouldn't cost more than 10k ..... unfortunately the houses are adopting these prices to recover the annual turnover ....... happy for them ü§î, but the motorcycle market is increasingly dead"
1755,"Always very bad the same, too bad. Much better tracer 09"
1756,"You haven't talked about consumption, perhaps the real Achilles heel of the previous mt-10 ; The technicians have declared that they have come down "
1757,"listen to the proof and you would immediately go to the dealer to get it, then open your eyes and ü§Æ"
1758,The R1 derivation makes the MT-10 sportier and more performing than the CB .... it depends on what you are looking for in a motorcycle.
1759,"But why does Yamaha have a hideous front end? Too bad, super engine, excellent chassis, line can be there, but the optical group is ugly. (personal opinion)"
1760,Really bad ... too bad.
1761,"In true MT style (That is, Maxmum Torque - maximum torque -). Beautiful without too many frills."
1762,Nice review. I like this a lot & I can live with the looks despite not loving them. Compariitively good value & if I was in the market for a super naked I'd be choosing between this & the GSXS1000 in terms of bang for your buck. The hyper naked's are fun & all but they're just too much of everything in terms of cost & power imo.
1763,I like its minimal tech and relatively affordable price point. I‚Äôd definitely like to add one to my garage in the near future.
1764,"I like the tidy up of the rear section and reduction of all the little fiddly plastic bits, but I much prefer the look and character of my re-flashed 2018 SP. Such a versatile machine, and never fails to put a grin on my face. Don't think I'll be looking to replace it with the new model any time soon."
1765,I still think it‚Äôs more worth it to get the old model at half price and fix all the issues it comes with stock. It‚Äôs a hell of a machine. Honestly my favorite bike.
1766,"Interesting comments regarding the front end and brakes. I own previous gen and did pads and now i trail brake hard all the time - loads of feel. And for the front end, I love it, loads of feel..."
1767,I absolutely adore the sound of that motor
1768,the BMW S1000R - very comparable power and featurewise.
1769,"Sounds like an Aprilia V4 with Japanese reliability. Wheelie monster, might be my next bike"
1770,"It did not seem to be that stable through some of those corners, and the rider looked a bit hesitant Decent wheelie though"
1771,"I have a street bike and now I'm in love with this one , need to get one"
1772,It must be said that this bike is wheelie good. üëçüòé
1773,MT10 is still the best naked for 2up riding which is one of the main reasons I will buy one. It's a blast riding alone or 2up with a lovely damsel. Can't say the same for a lot of its rivals.
1774,"It must be amazing to ride, but it looks absolutely terrible Whith a taller windscreen it looks A BIT better"
1775,"Google 2022 mt10 windscreen, makes it look a bit like an r1, and not a bug with eyebrows"
1776,I'd take the previous gen over this new one any day.
1777,"I just don't like the looks of it compared to the last gen. Missing small fairings, different front piece, air scoops too high, etc.."
1778,I'd agree the last gen looks better (still out there though) but the electronics on this model swing it for me. 
1779,I don't like the new styling of mt09 but it will grow on you and appreciate it
1780,I miss the sharp angular looks of the old one‚Ä¶
1781,"This mt10 has the front lamp design like the face of a bee and sting the opponent painfully, it is really really marvelous. The Streetfighter and Z1000 have the front lamps just like the head of a red ant fears the opponents."
1782,I wish the steering stabilizer was not visible but it is what it is ü•≤
1783,Who would have thought Yamaha would base their MT10 on Johnny 5 from the 1986 classic Short Circuit
1784,The mt10 is a better bike by far than the 1290..
1785,I'll be going with the 1290 SuperDuke R. ;)
1786,Maybe not the ‚Äúcheapest ‚Äú.. I‚Äôd say the least expensive üëå
1787,"it's a great bike, wish I had gone that way and not Ducati!"
1788,The insect look has grown on me. I like the praying mantis head on it more and more every time I see it.
1789,It‚Äôs a good year for Yamaha
1790,Someone over at Yamaha design headquarters thought that adding eyebrows on a bike would be a great idea!
1791,"Great bike, but i hope they fixed this blow up engine."
1792,Tuono. Much more style imo. MT10 is a tacky designed freak compared to the Italians
1793,must say MTs are getting more hideous every year
1794,Somehow they managed to make this one look even worse than the previous one.
1795,It never was the top dog. The MT09 has always had a better power to weight ratio. And the Super Duke R exists. Lol
1796,"you'd think with Rossi riding their Yamaha bikes, that they'd be able to get some of his input on design of the headlights area.. ugliest of the lot, not even close to any of the european rivals.. a waste really"
1797,"Great review. But no. This thing is not on par with the speedy or SD 1290 or the tuono, much less the duc streetfighter, zh2, etc"
1798,Needs its old face back. Those brow lights suck
1799,What a whinger this guy is complaining about the mpg. You do not buy this bike for fuel economy it's all about the fun factor. Otherwise look elsewhere of you want fuel economy.
1800,"Dual headlights but only one lights up, that's rubbish."
1801,Why the Miami Vise colors from 1989? Looks bad.
1802,Looks bad
1803,Nope
1804,If we are talking MAD nothing comes close to the Superduke 1290 R...Nothing
1805,"bruh, i rode an 2018 mt10 for like a week and that bike was utter trash, horrible engine breaking, choppy/imprecise throttle, overall crap unless all you do is highway cruising. not confidence inspiring at all."
1806,ugliest color combo
1807,This new desig of front face (with this eye brow) is ü§Æ
1808,It appears that Yamaha addressed all the shortcomings of the original MT10. The styling has improved a lot too. As a Tuono V4 owner I have always liked the big Yamaha supernaked
1809,"Don't listen to them, MT-10. You're a strong, independent super naked and you don't need anyone's affirmation when it comes to your looks."
1810,Great review! Absolutely love the look of the new MT 10! Can not wait to see the SP version! Defo getting one or the other this spring!
1811,"What a perfect weekender! I saw the tail bag, and understand there's a tank bag and a more long-ride oriented screen. Looks incredible in black! And, yeah, that's MORE than enough power for just about any street! Great review, and nice job Yamaha!"
1812,Bike is built for fun...ü§™ Not for the ‚õΩ mileage and all that fuzz Enjoy the ride üëåüèªüëçüèª
1813,Plenty of power to keep up with all the competition.
1814,"I love the effortless wheelies, and the slightly more upright riding position too. Don't like the toothpaste colored model, but the dark blue/black looks really good. Can't wait for your review of the SP version ! Oh, and I love the fly screen with LED lights too. Is that factory O.E. or aftermarket?? Looks O.E. to me. Obviously it is."
1815,Did I miss any mention about the brakes? That was an area of needs improvement on the previous generation that I‚Äôm hoping is resolved in this iteration.
1816,"at least from my perspective as an MT10 owner. The statement about the horsepower is especially accurate. The 160+ hp MT10 has a more forceful pull in the midrange compared to the 200 hp R1. The R1 pulls harder in the top end compared to the the MT10 but that top end power has not been lost in the MT10 engine - it has been transferred to the mid-range. For a street rider this is a definite win. Sure the MT10 will go very fast, but with the upright sitting position it isn't very fun for a prolonged period. Pulling out of a fast sweeping corner in 3rd and feeling that incredible pull while the front wheel lofts is where this bike shines. It also doesn't hurt that Yamaha's bikes are very reliable compared to some of the more exotic brands. I've owned many bikes and the MT10 is my favourite."
1817,"Best bike I've ever owned and it's not even close. I've had Kawaski 636's, a GSXR750, a naked Kawi 650 and this is the most fun and most comfortable bike I've ever had. I always joke with people How if gets stolen (I live in Los Angeles) I would immediately just go out and buy the same fucking bike again. It's that good lol. Cheers!"
1818,I'm on the side of I really like the look of the new mt10 üòÅüòç
1819,I have a 2022 r7 as my first bike and put about 6k miles on it. I Am very excited to upgrade to the mt-10 when it hits dealerships soon!
1820,Love this bike. Throw on the Yamaha windscreen and bags and you've got a super ST!
1821,i have an mt09 and would love to add mt10 into garage - looks like a great bike
1822,"I might not give up my 10 for a new one, but it‚Äôs a nice bike."
1823,"According to the website the tank size is still 4.5 gallons for 2022, though claimed MPG went from 30mpg to 35mpg for 2022. This means a theoretical 157 mile range, up from 135 miles in 2021. To me the lack of range was the biggest shortcoming of the bike. If fuel mileage is actually improved, that is helpful, but another gallon in the tank would be much appreciated as well."
1824,160-180hp is perfect for top level super nakeds IMO. No need for more than that.
1825,Good bike but a bit supersportish for me. I'm thinking of the new XSR900.
1826,"I love the yams ,but they are a bit too juicy compared to the competition ,especially if your using as a commuter as well ,that said I own a yam and the cp3 motor is a happy compromise ."
1827,"I've never ridden one, but this is probably my favorite naked bike."
1828,"Never ride it. If you do, you'll definitely buy it the same day. Believe me, I've done over 40000kms on one since in the last 3years, it still gives me a stiffy, every single time. Will be getting the SP version this year or the next, depends on availability."
1829,"I'm going to ride one of these back to back with a GSXS1000GT because with a screen, the MT10 looks like it can do the sports tourer thing too"
1830,"You can get a Weekend pack, screen, comfort seat, tail pack. They used to do a tour version, but the bike is ultimately hampered by range - the old girl is still quite thirsty!"
1831,I am contemplating trading my tuono for it .
1832,"These bikes are stupid easy to wheelie lol, it‚Äôs literally one of the funniest bikes I rode, I‚Äôd just get a 1st Gen Fz/Mt10"
1833,"Love it, and yes I recall the Isle of Man tt game one of my favourites."
1834,It go zoom!! This is on my list for my third or next!!
1835,I have a MT07 and will upgrade soon. Soooo much competion in this catergory (KTM 1290/Triumph Speed Triple etc) but I figure this is hard to beat for the DOLLAR
1836,It's good value if you don't plan to ride it too much. Otherwise this is one of the thirstiest bikes on the market.
1837,Go for a Speedie mate. Bought my '18 RS with only 1000 km on it and have had the best 3 years of riding ever. Love it.
1838,harder suspension kinda put me off (2021). Most reviewers loved that bike but all noted the ride was a bit harsh on some rougher roads. Wish they had adjustable ohlins like on the RR
1839,"how do you rate it against the new GSXS1000? Much more bike for the money, and it feels a bit more special. Both are very good value though, it's not an easy choice."
1840,I‚Äôm thinking the MT10 may be my next bikeü§û
1841,Exactly why the mt09 is in my sights
1842,Literally came here for the MPG and he said he doesnt have it :'(
1843,i heard they did some lexus Lfa type magic on this years mt-10.
1844,What a beast! 
1845,anyone knows if you can fit a previous model headlight on it?
1846,New Master of Ugly üòÇ
1847,"come on! It's not that bad, I actually quite like it!"
1848,in pictures in looks horrible but now i see it in your video it looks alright not bad at all!
1849,mt09 look better in person but this one is truly ugly
1850,Great machine
1851,Is it ¬£1k better than the last model? Nope its basically the exact same bike with a bigger price tag I was going to buy one but I think this is a big let down. The standard seat is good for the bin as is most of the shoddy plastic bits
1852,"recommend me,MT10 or bmw s1000r? MT 10 SP üëçüèªüëå"
1853,"It's a hard bike not to fall for. The fun factor is strong with this one, you can't help but smile when you ride it!"
1854,"You say a touring edition will be available, but the Yamaha web site does not show any panniers as accessories - only a large tail pack. Also, no touring screen is listed. The MT10 makes a brilliant sports tourer, so lets hope Yamaha step up to the mark. If I were to upgrade my 2020 model, would I be able to fit my Hepco pannier brackets? It doesn't look like it, as the rear subframe is now completely faired in with no mounting points visible. The only option would be SW Motech Blaze kit, but there's no way I would upgrade and then have to junk my existing panniers and sport-rack with tail bag. I'd either keep the bike and spend a lot less on a suspension upgrade, or simply change brands - SDR for"
1855,I've ridden the first generation MT10 a few times and it's an amazingly fun bike. My last bike was the FZ1 and I had to have the European naked model parts shipped to America to make it look right. I just can't get past how ugly modern naked bikes have become.
1856,It could look like a bull‚Äôs rear end sewn shut with barbed wire and I wouldn‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs about how I feel after thrashing it and living to tell about it. I‚Äôll leave the ‚Äúpretty‚Äùbikes for those hoping to get a ‚Äúlike‚Äù on social media so they can sleep at night.
1857,My 2018 is just fine ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1858,"Triumph called, they want their drl‚Äôs back."
1859,I wonder if you could fit the old lights and bits to this one. They didnt improve the front look
1860,SP is the newest VMAX without the name!!
1861,"After having a new original mt10 for 10k ¬£13,300 for the new one is just crazy and now you're in the realms of a tuono which was never the aim for the mt10 so I think the lines have blurred and the popularity will definitely suffer."
1862,The stink bug look needs to go away.
1863,Petrol prices make this too thirsty now
1864,"You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig. Front end of bikes are getting worse. The engine is brilliant, but the more you play the less miles you get. After about 80 miles your looking for a petrol station. Only way it's getting 150 mile range is by pushing it. I think I got 120 miles on the original, and that was riding it like miss daisy. What are you actually getting for the extra 3k from the original ü§î."
1865,i like it
1866,"God it is f**k ugly. I was one of the few that LOVED the original gen's angular transformer face. But these ""painted on eyebrows"" don't do it for me. Better fuel economy and a TFT would be nice, but I think I'll get a lightly used gen 1 and use the savings for a system, flash, and better brake pads."
1867,So many of the new bikes are uuuuuugly. No exception here.
1868,"this bike is very thirsty, very few people would want to tour on this. The ones who do already committed with aftermarket upgrades a long time ago."
1869,"Maaaaan, i still can't get around that look..ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢"
1870,I think like the MT-09 it'll be a grower!
1871,mt09 looks better in person but surley wait for update not buy this
1872,MT stand for master of terrible looking thing?
1873,I don‚Äôt get all the fuss about the styling. It‚Äôs not like the old one was such a beauty. I don‚Äôt like either but there is not such a big difference between them anyway.
1874,The colors ü§Æthe black one oküëç
1875,Who tf thought that putting eyebrows on a bike would look good?
1876,"Dreambike, but so expencive her in Norway ü§Ø 25.000 euro"
1877,"Why are modern bikes so ugly? I want to buy a new bike, but its like trying to pull in a disco full of wildebeest."
1878,Are those the eyes or the eyebrows?
1879,Mt10 the most underrated motorcycle no one knows about
1880,"It's not really a great thing to say that the MT10 has a recognisable brand image. It looks like it was drawn with a crayon by a bored skool kid in detention. The front looks like Dame Edna Everidge with constipation. Still, what a fabulous bike. I would far, far prefer the MT10 to a Ducati whatever. Fabby machine."
1881,Interesting insights in terms of its competition. For a street bike lower speed torque is a plus over top end. Still it seems to be the better all rounder in the sport naked class just down on lower rpm torque but otherwise better especially with the BMW dealer network and warranty. Great bike if you only want one.
1882,Good bike. I want one still. üëåüëå
1883,"Thanks for the review, but what would your choice be, this bmw s1000r or the triumph speed triple 1200 rs? Ans :Speed triple "
1884,"Oh the curse of the motorcycle vlogger, the flat battery üîã. I was surprised to hear you mention the seating position was uncomfortable. I would‚Äôve thought that the difference between the R and RR, in that regard, would‚Äôve been night and day."
1885,Yeah I was thinking it would be way more comfortable but not really. 
1886,"I have an F900r and although they are both similar sized BMW naked bikes, I was kinda taken aback how aggressive the riding position is on the S1000. I guess BMW would point you towards the XR if you want more comfort, but I feel a naked sports bike should really be more street focused tbh."
1887,yeah it‚Äôs a little strange because tbh I would just buy a RR with over 200hp and shift cam for the low down grunt. For 1k more then the single R
1888,"yep. I like the bike, but honestly it's really expensive when you compare it like for like with other inline four nakeds."
1889,well it‚Äôs better then say a MT10 and a Suzuki. But 28k you can get the Ktm and for 29k the v4 street fighter bace model.
1890,"You say it needs the shift cam for low end power. It's already tuned for low end power. It lacks the high end power, because no shift cam."
1891,The shift cam helps down low power like the RR. It has high end power this. It just feels soft down low. 
1892,I thought the power band kicks in around 6k and you took for a ride around town ü§î no low end
1893,the v4S but it is a lot of money and you can get the bmw for a lot less It‚Äôs a hard one but I would say the v4 is king
1894,"Maybe take it above 4k rpm before saying it has no torque. Coming from an MT10 I can tell you 2021 R lacks no grunt it's just slightly higher up than the vtwins, v4s and crossplanes. Not too high - in the midrange (redline is all the way up at 12k). Sorry but but was a very half arsed test ride, too swift to judge what is an epic motorcycle"
1895,"I had the new s1000rr and didn't like the shiftcam because at low revs it didn't have as much torque, only after 6k and high speeds. In this R, not having this system, I thought that Acceleration was more abrupt... on my current GS which has shiftcam is very responsive at low rpm ü§î confusing"
1896,Shift cam helps with low down torque and pull. The RR here in Australia is very responsive. Over in the USA the RR was very restricted are you in the USA or probably a US spec bike 
1897,"Understand. I am from Brazil. Here the restrictions are a little annoying too. In low rotation it wasn't fun :(. I'm waiting for the release of this new R to see if it pays off. I'd like Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple,But I don't think it's coming here."
1898,"I have just come from a 2018 s1000rr which I have owned for 3 years and my intention was to buy the new s1000r as a natural step down because of knee problems but I find this s1000r lack lustre, bland and it does not excite me. It is a nice bike but the best thing about it is the TFT, I loved my 2018 s1000rr and I thought it was better than the 2019 s1000rr. I think it is a big let down coming from my s1000rr to this 2021 s1000r. I think that if you where upgrading from a similar naked it would be ok because it is a nice bike and the sports package comes in at around ¬£14000 but that is the problem, its just a nice bike with an awesome TFT."
1899,It is just ok I‚Äôm not sold on it but I do get how people love them. It‚Äôs just missing something for me. 
1900,What is your pick between the Triumph Speed Triple RS 1200 and this S1000R? Speed all day long.
1901,Yeah they should have put the shift cam in it. Petite would have paid the extra 1G for it for sure. BMWs reasoning is hogwash
1902,Such a boring bike. I rode the same model twice last week. They really fucked it up not including shift cam
1903,"at 11k rpm you have the maximum power, not the torque (which is instead at type 9k). Anyway true, the curve they managed to get is really good, at 4000 it is almost 90Nm !!"
1904,"Too bad for the front, really anonymous!"
1905,"it feels really smooth in cornering and also good for use in everyday traffic. As far as aesthetics are concerned, I am not particularly enthusiastic. This year the Naked are a little disappointing me from this point of view. As usual, excellent test drive Arrow üí™üèª"
1906,"Tested at the bmw test ride a few days ago: when you have to look carefully if the 1000 you are getting on is unequivocally it indicates that it lacks a bit of personality; I got off my, previous model 2020, and I say goodbye on the new one is unquestionable a lightness and compactness of reference, finally the clutch lever is adjustable and does not force you to buy after, I expected much more torque at the bottom I did not hear it, vibrations nn I felt them so annoying, the Dashboard is embarrassing to read but it is the same as that of 100 other bikes !!!! However, I find the grade 7 a bit low Arrow I would give it a full 8 üò¨"
1907,I'm sorry that you don't like the previous model but also a distinctive feature of BMW was precisely having asymmetrical headlights ... but oh well a matter of taste ...
1908,My speed triple 1050 RS develops 117 nm at 7250 rpm ... These euro 5 a little disappoint me ... They give more horsepower to the turns than you don't use on the road. Too bad because I really like the new BMW so aesthetically. Vibration speech also left me there a little bitter. I hope they will solve this problem soon.
1909,"With exhaust and rims of the M package it reaches an embarrassing lightness for a thousand üòç, I think 189kg (empty and on scales, not declared)"
1910,"What a motorbike, the M version, spicy !!"
1911,Super fun bike super smooth engine ... super arrowü§ô
1912,"Aesthetically, we like the old one more ... the engine is similar ... you can hardly see the differences"
1913,"she is a jap, disguised as a bmw üëç"
1914,That's not the bmw.
1915,Honestly ... I like everything except the choice of rear lights.
1916,"I confirm on the rear without integrated headlight I do not understand the aesthetic sense, even on other sporty brands, it is fine only on custom"
1917,what a bomb
1918,"But the engine is exactly the same one that fits on yours and also my BMW s 1000 XR !!! And looking at the speedometer / rev counter, the ratios also seem identical to me. It shouldn't be new ."
1919,How did you find the gearbox? I went to try it and it seemed a bit hard to insert the gears
1920,"I tried it this morning, the electronic one I found it hard only at low revs, instead using the clutch always a butter"
1921,I don't like the sight of the tft thrown in there. It seems to float in the air‚Ä¶ surely with a windshield it improves it
1922,An eyesore like the new xr
1923,"The back is identical to the s1000rr, too bad the front and the mirrors of the scooters but those are changed (luckily)"
1924,Strange that a 4L vibrates so much. They are usually very balanced.
1925,very beautiful beast .. pity it costs a blunder ..
1926,The front 1000 times more shit than the old one
1927,it will be a sex toy ... but I always prefer Aprilia and Ducati .
1928,Great technical skills but I find it ugly
1929,"the S1000r doesn't seem to trigger euphoria in you. Definitely a great bike, but without much of a ""want to have"" factor."
1930,the bike: great!
1931,i like her Mask still takes some getting used to. Technically certainly great üëçüèª as always from BMW.
1932,"My thought: technically super, but boring optics, not even a single-sided swingarm. If I then hear from Vauli at the end that he doesn't think the look is plump either, that speaks for your credibility again üí™üèª Most vloggers don't dare to say something like that. üëçüèª"
1933,"In the beginning I never liked the asymmetrical mask, but the more often it came towards me, the more awesome I found it! Otherwise a good bike"
1934,"All in all a good overall package in my opinion. The handlebars somehow seem super narrow, maybe that's deceptive. Of the new products for 2021, I think they're the most beautiful next to the Monster, so not too much has been tried out."
1935,"The S1000 R has definitely turned out to be a fine bike, no question about it. But BMW missed the unique opportunity to put an equivalent of the Aprilia 1100 V4 Tuono Factory on wheels. That would have been a version with a cockpit fairing in the design of the BMW S1000 RR, as presented by the ingenious computer modder Kar Lee. THAT would have been a bike for the heart! By the way: I have to admit that I like the reports from Vauli and Mex best, because not everything is automatically ""easy"" or ""madness"" or some other superlative. The Vauli and the Mex also say very clearly if there is something to criticize in their eyes."
1936,"An R in the pulpit. Where then is the design difference to the RR? I'm glad she's naked. Otherwise it wouldn't have become my new one üòä Tuono is too small/tight for me as a nearly 2m person. The sound of the Aprilia is great, but ... just not enough for me. The equipment of the RM is great. I'm looking forward to the display with navigation system, chassis, the bangs, ..."
1937,"I have the 2015 S1000R and I'm still very satisfied, a really cool all-rounder. Unfortunately, I also think that the new one is a little too good looking. I didn't really like mine either, but after I test drove it it was a minor matter üòÄ"
1938,No more sound. No more punch due to the Euro norm. But we were very disappointed with the new lower part. No more performance. It's a shame. 2015 is a completely different bike
1939,I like the motorcycle
1940,"Interesting to see that from a Viennese perspective, Bayern have a blatant accent. I would have thought Austrian and Bavarian are basically one? A horny highway rocket by the way. I think BMW is sticking with 165hp and focusing on drivability and driving pleasure. Design actually more pleasing to me."
1941,"Except for the front, I really like the new naked Wei√üwurst very much üëçüèª technically and for driving it will be super and perfect!!!"
1942,"Chic bike, except for the 0815 front lamp, fits a MT-07, lacks character. I totally agree with you, asymmetrical with LED would have been cool. And the sound is hoarse and limp, not robust enough - compared to my Tuono."
1943,Great power bike the ideal country road robber...üëçüëåüí™
1944,"Compared to the R1250GS, the shift assistant on the 4-cylinder BMWs is very good."
1945,"Funny 2020/21 everyone wears annoying masks, even doe motorcyclesüòÇ Ne cool bike but a little more emotion in the design would have been safe with a different mask. But still a dream country road motorcycle :D"
1946,I think the bike is really great and would never give it back. But it would have been better if they left out the navigation assistant than delivering such junk.
1947,I drive the 19 and I'm happy about it :D 4k below the market price and with Bodis it shoots abnormally!
1948,Bikes are becoming increasingly sterile and unemotional. Visually also questionable and most of the new features are mostly electronics and adaptations for the EU standards (but the manufacturers can't do anything about that anyway).
1949,You have the brilliant idea with the headlights in 2009. An even better idea is to change the optics from the double R to the R. Then a marketing genius came up with the idea in 2021 to take away the identification mark of the really very good bikes. What was BMW thinking?
1950,"So I hated the old headlight. The RR looked good, the R looked mmn, like a drunk owl. I like the new one much better."
1951,"one should have adopted the ""eye shape"" of the double RR to position the R at shoulder height with the RR. However, you would have had to build a front mask √† la Aprilia Tuono to accommodate both headlights. However, what I find much more debatable than the lighting story is this extremely ugly exhaust with the bread box and the ugly colored manifold...either build a nice exhaust or hide the thing behind a front spoiler out of decency. I hope that has now also been heard in Munich and Spandau ;)"
1952,Such a bummer when the older model looks much much better. Reminds me of the M5 E39 situation.
1953,"Every time I see the handlebars, I'm amazed at the offset. Is there a noticeable difference to the classic naked bike handlebar, i.e. maybe a position in the direction of ""super athlete light""?   that seems to be misleading, because both the distance and the offset are ergonomically ok. It's also not uncomfortably stretched out"
1954,"I'm looking forward to the test drive, I think it looks really coherent"
1955,Symmetry‚ù§Ô∏è A treat for my eyes
1956,the old one is mmn. more aggressive and looks better
1957,"Bland ... unfortunately ... who doesn't want to take the older one, the used bike market will be happy, no kick, no fresh charisma, sad but true ;( No emotion tickled ..."
1958,"Even if I don't own a BMW, the asymmetric one was cooler."
1959,Really awesome bike!
1960,"I'm actually not someone who likes asymmetry. I still decided to go with the 1000r. Now that I see this ""new stuff"" I'm very happy about my ""winking"""
1961,"I don't have 1000s, but I have to say that the new design is just boring and doesn't look particularly good. Every time I see the predecessor, be it s1000r, xr or RR, I always think to myself: Dude, that was a great thing. Simply an eye-catcher and special design. And now... just a bit boring and not so eye-catching anymore :/"
1962,"Absolutely. But it should also be said that I find the new RR beautiful and clearly distinguishable despite the new mask. I really like this gap above and below the headlight, which also extends beyond that. As a naked bike fan, my expectations of the new face of the R were of course high..."
1963,"Yes, that's right. The new RR looks really great, but continuing the asymmetrical look would have been cooler for me"
1964,The switch assistant is by far the most harmonious at BMW!
1965,"I still don't believe that the chain is maintenance-free. Never in my life. Even the timing belts on the old F800 weren't maintenance free. At some point they were gone, and then a new one had to be found."
1966,I see the following advantages over the previous R: LED light better than previous funzel Steering angle further Lower speeds when driving further on BAB TFT display with goodies Suspension settings can be finely adjusted in the display USB connection chain maintenance-free 3-year guarantee Integrated basic navigation app with route recording Consumption -8 percent weight lower Wheelie Control sep. freedom of movement better MSR RDC nicer standard exhaust DDC further developed windshield better integrated (mountain start assist)
1967,Nobody notices consumption minus 8% and with such a stove it doesn't matter.
1968,I'm still really well served with my Euro 4!!! And the front is really a bit strange... I would have hoped for more...
1969,"definitely a good motorcycle again, but as emotional as a white sausage. The optics have become absolutely interchangeable and boring in my eyes. The driving performance is great, but can no longer quite keep up with the competition (Tuono, Streetfighter V4, Super Duke, Z H2). The basic price is attractive, but equipped with the nice things not much cheaper than the others. Somehow nothing half and nothing whole. some will love you for exactly that, it wouldn't be for me. The ""want to have"" feeling is much greater with the Tuono, Streetfighter and also the Duke. The Tuono is sportier, the Streetfighter very emotional and the Duke masters the discipline of country roads with the V2 and a lot of thumping from the low revs. The S1000R doesn't do anything wrong, but nothing outstanding either."
1970,"It's not just about engine power. You can see the Tuono quite well, which also likes to beat the Streetfighters and the Ducati V4 also achieves its stated performance. Detailed tests will then show how it fares against the competition."
1971,I don't need a shift assistant anyway. Shifting without the clutch was always enough for me.
1972,I'm actually considering switching from the MT10 at the moment...
1973,The weld seams on the flex frame are pure horror!
1974,Had to be given 120NM torque & 170PS. Disappointing that BMW didn't push the envelope. They lose pace against KTM & Ducati.
1975,Now she would only have to get the front based on the RR and everyone would be happy
1976,"To be honest, I think it's great what BMW is doing there... On the one hand, you get upset that you're driving with 200hp totally over motorized with the RR and there are statements like ""do you need that at all on the country road?"" and they then say with the R ""only 165 hp"".... I think basically nobody needs that either (unless you want to tell it at the regulars' table...). I think it's great that BMW puts the focus on drivability and is more known for giving the performance data a bit ""understated"". It's not much fun on the Autobahn anyway and the chances that you have to drive fast are almost non-existent anyway and it's much nicer to have a motorcycle that you can drive ""shift lazy"" for example and you can certainly do a lot with it accelerate well or just drive... I'm really very sorry, but I can't get used to the ""new design"" at all... I like the ""old"" one just like the RR is nicer... I recently did For example, seen the new Honda Supersport and I think it looks SO similar to the RR... Or the new R also looks ""like others"".... At that time you knew exactly when someone came across an S1000 (R or RR). is. But BMW has changed in general... Also that HUGE grill on the new cars... I think it looks like the car swallowed a beaver... When it comes to cars, I always have to think ""is what, doc?"" think :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V23X1OoDMZ4"
1977,165hp for a naked bike is more than enough.
1978,"It effectively pushes more on the rear wheel. The BMW was measured by French journalists with 169hp, the Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple with 163hp, the Duke with 173 and the Street Fighter had 200hp on the rear wheel... so it's not weak and not the weakest. Driveability (I test drove) the best of all and with this power the most powerful weapon on passes and country roads. Ordered‚Ä¶ :)"
1979,yeah every dyno puts other numbers out. i also think the s1000r is much more powerful than ktm and speed triple
1980,"in the end, all it's power is meaningless if you can not squeeze it out. so i think the bmw get's all the recommendations because of this fact. it is the easiest bike to ride and this shows how good r&d was. on curvy mountainroads specs doesn't count as much as skills and drivebility"
1981,"still what kind of brakes?! The previous model had Brembos and you can clearly feel the difference! The facelift is a step backwards in my opinion and now looks like everything BMW does on naked bikes from the front... the facelift on the double R looks great... I'm super disappointed with the R. No recognition value at all - nothing The rear light is more practical, but it doesn't look as high-quality either. The brake fluid reservoir isn't that great either... Better than the piss cup from the predecessor, but worlds uglier than from the double R... What I don't like - the thing has GPS, whether you want it or not..."
1982,Lazy just like that. Violence from below is the optimum on the country road and not top performance. That's why Boxer Boxer Boxer the motorcycle should look like a Tuono or S1000R and not like an R1250R. So we need a boxer with 150 hp with the corresponding torque and the above-mentioned appearance = bestseller I've been preaching since the first K1200Rü§î
1983,Disfiguring such an expensive bike with a few parts like lamp and rear is also an art...20 K for the M is really tough
1984,"Optically good, except for the bland headlights. new fairing nice and especially nice the new rear frame. Had a 2015 Euro 3 and it drove unbelievably, the only thing that bothered me was the traction control, which didn't allow any gas even in Dynamic Pro mode at a steep angle."
1985,"Solid model, but without the ""want to have"" factor. It would have really needed and deserved an independent mask without the Biedermeier association of the ""R 1250R""."
1986,You can really try for a long time to convince that the new engine is better than the old one :) everything he says about the new engine applies to the old one
1987,"I had shortlisted the BMW, in the end it was the price and the rather boring look that put me off. The basic price is much lower, but the packages are so stupid that when I configured them, they became significantly more expensive. I also find this pricing policy very dishonest. To put up a bike that nobody buys anyway and then to get angry at the extras that everyone wants. BMW also did not want to be negotiated with. So it became a Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple 1200 RS. The only ""downer"" is the non-active chassis, which in turn saves weight and keeps service costs lower."
1988,"the Triumph you have a noble √ñhlins chassis, awesome brake pump and top brakes, plus a bike with character I think you made the right decision üëçüëç"
1989,"I really like it, the optics, the technology, I think everything is great and not stuffy. BUT, why only 165 hp, why not the ShiftCam motor? So annoying. This is constantly being talked about nicely and that you don't need it. And stop me with the babble you can't use it anyway. Of course, you can also savor this on the country road. With brains and brains where it is possible. Why would anyone upgrade from a Tuono or Superduke and then take a step backwards in terms of performance. No, I'm keeping my Aprilia and my KTM.."
1990,"165 hp is enough for everyone, unless you just want blatant acceleration from over 200, but a naked bike doesn't make sense there"
1991,"I don't know what everyone has, of course the new exhaust systems don't look so nice with their bread box, but the sound really wasn't that bad."
1992,"With the new mask, the goat loses all charisma."
1993,"The new RR and R are just disappointing for me. The asymmetry of the headlights was always the best, you could tell from afar what was coming."
1994,"Find it a pity that the exhaust shooting & babbling has only been programmed in the Dynamic Pro... As a country road driver - only driver, I'm mainly on the road in ""road"" or at most ""dynamic""... But in the ""dynamic Pro"" pretty much all electronic helpers are actually never switched off. Is it somehow possible to activate the exhaust shooting in the other driving modes? With more activated safety electronics? @1000Ps In which mode was the sound check in the video?"
1995,"You can configure DYNAMIC PRO completely freely and, if you wish, set it up just as defensively as RAIN, ROAD or DYNAMIC (engine mapping, engine braking, ABS setting, traction control and wheelie control can be individually adjusted). According to the video, the sound check was in DYNAMIC PRO with the preset sharpest engine mapping, which includes the babble."
1996,"I always thought that, even if I can arm the electronic helpers, they regulate a lot less than, for example, in road mode (eg: abs works but much later."" In road, rain & dynamic, the ABS is also active, but regulates different strengths Could I really configure a 1 to 1 copy of the road mode, only with activated engine babble as the only difference? Because the babble has nothing to do with ""safety-relevant settings"" such as wheelie control & abs ... That would be great if that would work like this! üòÄ"
1997,"""Engine mapping"" refers to the basic tuning of the engine. In this specific case, it is about the throttle response, i.e. how many degrees the throttle valve is opened at how many degrees the throttle grip position. In RAIN the throttle response is soft, in the other modes it is direct. In addition, the available torque depends on the engine mapping depending on the gear. In RAIN we cap the maximum torque in the lowest 3 gears, in ROAD and DYNAMIC in the lowest 2 gears, in DYNAMIC PRO in no gear. How so? Quite simply, if the driver tells the moped that it is wet and slippery, for example by selecting ""RAIN"" mode, it makes no sense to release engine power that we know from the start will be too great for the available grip. Just imagine ""Grip"" can be a number between 0 (ice surface) and 100 (racing slicks on race track asphalt): the traction control must constantly guess the right number within this range (or approach it: ""Is the number greater than 55? Yes! Is it greater than 91? No! Greater than 68? Yes! Greater than 70? No! OK: Allow 69 pieces of power!!""). By choosing the right mode, you make life much easier for traction control. It is told, for example, by RAIN that only a number between 0 and 10 will be plausible in first gear. Therefore we cap the torque for all areas where numbers >10 would be reached. So the chance of guessing the correct ""traction number"" is no longer 1:100, but1:10. This enables significantly finer, faster and more precise control. Our WSBK guys were so confident that they wanted to use these algorithms when it was still very early in development. Anyway, I digress. In ROAD and DYNAMIC we cap less torque because ROAD is designed for safe driving in dry conditions and DYNAMIC for dynamic driving in dry conditions (the parameters for ABS, electronic damping, etc. also change at the same time, but that would go beyond the scope) . The engine mapping in ROAD and DYNAMIC is identical. Depending on the gear, we allow as much power that optimal acceleration is achieved. The difference between the two driving modes is that the wheelie and ABS rules, which are also linked, are different. ROAD always keeps the wheels on the ground, while DYNAMIC allows the front wheel (rear wheel) to lift slightly when accelerating (braking) for maximum performance. So if you configure DYNAMIC PRO to be everything like ROAD, just the sharpest motor mapping (the DYNAMIC PRO mapping) is selected, then it will also behave like ROAD (wheelie control will prevent wheelies, ABS will be designed for stability, traction control will be for mixed grip conditions in dry conditions). The only difference is that the torque is NOT cut in the first two gears - so you make life harder for traction control and wheelie control (= always have to guess a number between 0 and 100), but they will still protect you. And yes, you have the thrust bubbles with you."
1998,"The F1000R - the design total failure of the S series... Nothing - but also nothing on the face of the ""F""1000R reminds of the sisters from the S series. I get a pulse every time I see the front. I'm so happy about my 2014 S1000R, which has now carried me 46,000 km. The ""F""1000R will certainly drive brilliantly and is still the reference to the competition in terms of price-performance with comparable equipment. Only the design of the ""successor"" to my S1000R will make me fall in love with Triumph. For me, the 1200 Speedy is currently the only one with a distinctive design and finally without the chubby ass and underseat puffs... Farewell BMW."
1999,I'm with you when it comes to the doughy shift assistant - that's been on all models of the S series since the 2017 Assi-Pro.
2000,Would have liked it better if BMW had facelifted the old mask instead of completely changing the design.
2001,"The old S1000 R really wasn't a bad motorcycle, so that's totally understandable. If you can save a good ‚Ç¨5,000, then that makes up for the fact that you don't get a TFT display. And due to the shorter translation, the old one pulls through even better than the new one. However, I would miss the thermometer, which the old S1000 R unfortunately never had and which provides a very important value in terms of tire grip."
2002,"In the past, the 1000s were immediately recognized by their appearance. The new one looks just like the F900R from the front"
2003,"I wouldn't buy it because I find the headlight boring and the variable valve timing is missing, with it you could have increased the torque instead of the peak power!"
2004,The old one looked much better. The front reminds me of the R1200 RS
2005,Front reminds me of a grom
2006,too bad they didn't take the rr front
2007,"Precisely because the device is supposed to work on country roads, the Shiftcam would have brought about a significant improvement. And once again no BMW navigator installed. Then it would have been noticed that this is not compatible with the Connectivity-Navigation and that you can not access the BMW navigator in the sports display "
2008,"Finally the motorcycles from BMW look great. I never got into this asymmetrical thing. Very nice bike, looking forward to a test drive!"
2009,"These lights all look the same now, which is a shame"
2010,"I can't help it, but with almost all new-generation motos the ""pot"" in front of the rear tire just doesn't work for me! ü§Æ especially pronounced with this one!!! Then something else with less ‚Äúpot‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶."
2011,Terrible. Hopefully this is a pre-production model.üëé
2012,"... looks like a run-of-the-mill Japanese bike... and those rough welds on the frame don't work at all üôà the sound is also a joke... better look for the ""old"" one on the used market, it's still a character bike üëåüèª"
2013,"The moped will then press harder again like all S1000R, it doesn't need more horsepower anyway."
2014,I like it better than the old one... I couldn't deal with the asymmetry.
2015,The old one was definitely prettier
2016,Stick with my 2018
2017,Exactly the same Honda has also recognized. You don't need 200 hp on a naked bike whose territory is the country road.
2018,"The welds are not particularly well made, it could be better."
2019,Looks like a G310 on steroids..
2020,The sound is absolutely meager and doesn't come close to the old ones or anything Italian. üëéüëé
2021,I personally find the design boring. Reminds me of a 10 year old Suzuki naked bike
2022,Boring bike!
2023,"Somehow she is too conservative, too good, too obliging. Rather almost schiach, but sensational. See ZH2. The designers have tried hard not to do anything wrong. Technically it's definitely 1A, but I wouldn't buy it because it's too bland. ZH2 because crazy performance and borderline optics or the Streetfighter."
2024,"Really sad 5 kilos less 1 kilo just because of the smaller tank, I was really looking forward to it but unfortunately not as hoped"
2025,The front is too accommodating or not aggressive enough for me.
2026,"The seat is available for different driver sizes, which was not mentioned here. Unfortunately also not that she no longer has Brembo calipers at the front."
2027,"Well, it probably won't be the year of beautiful new releases."
2028,"Sry but to put it bluntly, the thing looks like shit."
2029,it's just boring mush and stuffy.
2030,Hot.
2031,"Front ugly sound worse Same performance as before. Whole 6kg lighter. Thank you, stay with the predecessor and lose 6 kg yourself üòã"
2032,"As a more classic BMW fan, it's not mine, somehow optically a bit bland. Technically safe 1a. üëç"
2033,"I don't like the front because it just looks like an F900R from the front. Typical modular system, unfortunately"
2034,"You could have saved yourself that thing! Apparently they have really drawn from the full üò¨ There are now enough nicer things .......... Have they now heralded the new generation of designers at BMW üôà See also cars, well then have fun üòû"
2035,Again typical Bavarian mishmash ... no emotion. I praise my tuna
2036,Everything may be great. But it's not sexy. Was there ever actually a BMW that was sexy?
2037,Shift assistant is top on the Honda Cb 1000 r. Honda is the leader there.....optically it's totally boring. But that is almost all BMWs.My opinion!!!
2038,"It may be boring for a Ducatisti, but at least what's on BMW works, which is not always the case with the reds. That's called emotional..."
2039,"These are old prejudices that are no longer true. My Duc only sees the workshop for service. However, BMW is and will remain boring"
2040,Boring bike. Ducati Streetfighter V4S or Aprilia Tuono 1100 Factory superior to this ugly BMW. Now BMW uses Amwrican crap Hayes brakes and no √ñhlins.
2041,Certainly a good bike. But I personally liked the old mask better. I wouldn't buy the new one because of the looks.
2042,Bike looks absolutely stunning

2059,"if I'm not mistaken, the BMW S1000R already has a launch control mode, but it's in hidden features, which means it's a hidden feature. If it doesn't work, you have to use dynamic mode, then press the start button and hold it that way, after holding it the shifter light keeps on burning like that. that mean launch control ready to use and.. harr harr harr harrüòÜ"
2060,Dream bikeü§©
2061,"For daily use, the gsxs 750 is better than the s1000r in terms of handling, weight, fuel consumption, control if the s1000r is good in riding position but again it's a matter of taste"
2062,"The motor made by bmw must be sophisticated, sophisticated according to me,, the best superbike"
2063,This is the most mevvah motorbike
2064,The motor is powerful
2065,"when I climb I try to lower the gear, the clutch doesn't go to Neutral :v"
2066,This motorbike is not suitable in Indonesia because the roads are jammed everywhereüôèüèª
2067,"if in indo it's 600 million brati, bro magic, bli in the USA 200 million"
2068,This is an American motorcycle taxi üòÇ
2069,This motorbike is so cool
2070,The headlamp is not good. The engine is so cute.
2071,Ducati Streetfighter V4S is cooler.. When will BMW make a new Naked Bike model.. so it's fresh..
2072,Like the motor is powerful
2073,"The Neket version is great, but the fairing version is even better"
2074,Expensive: v
2075,"certainly a lot of stuff, but I don't think I could do without the sound of the aprilia v4! ü§©"
2076,it is a bike that I really like and with a good value for money if you do not overdo it with the bmw optional packages that take it a lot higher and no longer so competitive
2077,"I've seen more than one S1000R around, which is really beautiful for me."
2078,"Nice bike, excellent price / quality ratio, I was surprised by the fatigue of the brakes on the track ... cmq always good ... a üëã"
2079,"as former owner of S1000R 2019, and current owner of S1000XR 2021, I find that the engine pushes harder between 4000 and 7000 rpm, where then the old engine gave you the ""blow"" and gave the impression of going more for the ""turbo"" effect. I would like to point out that the Dynamic Pro map has unlocked torque while Road and Dynamic have reduced torque in the first 3 gears. Have you tried the Dynamic Pro? Isn't it that the impression of the lower midrange boost also comes from the noise emasculated by the Euro5, while the old one was much nastier in terms of sound? A direct comparison with shooting from 4000 rpm would be interesting"
2080,"I am a former owner of the s1000r (which I loved) and now I have a superduke 3.0 which is a disaster (which makes me regret that bike every day). The electronics have problems (serious and I hope they solve them for me), the supply is unmanageable. Below 4000 it disassembles, above it is a bull. The engine brake is intense up to 4000 rpm, if it drops below that speed then it sails (nice to be without support in the middle of the curve). Not to mention the ABS that enters all corners with a slightly bent bike and then stops braking and sends you into the other lane. To make you understand, I'm using it without any control because I'm afraid. Ah, I found the gear lever dangling, thank goodness I did not lose the pin because otherwise I had to call the wrecker. Yes, you have to tighten the screws like the Ducatis of 20 years ago. On the 30th I have an appointment in KTM but I can't wait to take it out. And I didn't take Aprilia for fear of having problems. However, I sold mine because it pissed water from the radiator and in BMW they told me it was ok."
2081,"I also come from a 2020 S1000R (which I loved) and I switched to a Super Duke 3.0 ten days ago ... but I did not detect any of the defects you speak of and I find the latter superior in practically everything: the torque is exaggerated, the handling is absurd (it has to be tried to believe, the changes of direction are lightning-fast as never on a vehicle of this type), fantastic electronics, impeccable suspension, relatively low consumption (in relation to the vehicle and the displacement), the The only note I make is the fluidity of the engine at low revs in the high gears which makes it almost impossible for you to use the sixth gear under 100kmh, but never mind, just get used to it. Of the S1000R I regret the fluidity of the engine at the bottom in every gear and the priceless barrels at the exhaust, but for the rest for me the orange is another world ... and then again for me the twin cylinder is the motorcycle engine par excellence. That said, the test confirms the impressions received by the dealer: a great quality vehicle, with a lot of rationality and little heart ... for me much better the old ignorant hooligan."
2082,"this bike (without problems) is a pleasure. The engine is extreme, as you say on the highway you go in fourth or fifth because the sixth without vibrations means 140/150. The suspensions are excellent because a click is enough to feel the benefits. (In fact I recommend a click to load, preload and mono because it becomes sublime, at most you go back). Bmw had an embarrassing fluidity at all revs and all gears, this is the opposite. But really I am driving with the fear of dying. If I've gotten to the point of overriding all controls on such a monster, you can understand my situation. I may have taken the wrong specimen, but I paid for it in full so I hope KTM recognizes the problem because I am in crisis. The moment they tell me they've done an update, I won't feel safe anyway. Too bad because every time I come back in the evening, I would like to leave and go get me a gas. And in any case it will be quicker to get into the fold, but with the S1000 you took the gas in your hand very much earlier, without the fear that it would throw you into hyperspace. Handling of power at the throttle is not comparable. And the sound ... mine was decat with the short Akra (with db) but it felt like a race bike."
2083,"leaves me perplexed, it doesn't seem to have a soul. Despite the improvements in the engine and electronics, the chassis is rather poor to me. And aesthetically it has lost its particularity: much more beautiful, in my opinion, the previous model."
2084,"The chassis is excellent. I assure you. As for the soul .... the electronics standardize delivery but today I finally notice that we are managing to make delivery and driving pleasure more tasty indeed. In short, we no longer notice (at least in this bike) that lack of connection between gas and engine response of a few years ago"
2085,"Fabulous bike‚Ä¶ ..the only defect that is difficult to go sensibly on the road‚Ä¶ .they are so ""easy"" bikes that you must always be careful not to risk life is the license‚Ä¶ .üëç"
2086,"His Majesty the BMW! Where the others trudge ... She walks, proudly taking off: DNA, and cost, aeronautical ... for this new VERY LIGHT SINGLE-STAGE MISSILE FOUR-CYLINDER WITH LIQUID PROPELLENT ... with six-axis stabilization, (more than Werner's V 2 von Braun) ... cost ... from WEAPON SYSTEM. To dream. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you Perfect !!!"
2087,"I am leaning towards the Speed ‚Äã‚Äã1200RS, although this is certainly a nice deck. Surprising some fall in style such as the mudguard or the brake compartment ""worsened"" compared to the previous model. Triumph question mark on the transfer of production to Thailand also for the Speed. They swear that the quality will be the same, we hope ..."
2088,Had the front braking system been entrusted to Brembo it might have had one less cons üòÅ
2089,in fact before it was Brembo
2090,The problem is with the pump
2091,"I like it aesthetically, technically it looks excellent, of course I am always of the idea that a fairing, (albeit minimal like thunder) on these bikes there should be"
2092,"Dear Perfect the torque follows a curve ..... @ 1200 rpm is NOT 114 Nm !!! , -) will be a little less .... however, as always, interesting tests. I don't have bikes of this kind, I have Africa, and I don't understand how to enjoy all the cavalry without any aerodynamic shelter."
2093,"The maps are 4 cmq .. The dinamic pro that now you can modify it at will .. From the engine brake to the tc to the abs anti wheelie acceleration response etc .. In short, the beauty ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2094,"Tested this morning for me, the only flaw it lightens the front end in full throttle acceleration and flaws otherwise fabulous"
2095,"I own a fz1 but almost, I'm giving it a serious thought in the purchase after your very detailed explanation always"
2096,"I prefer my MT-10. The moto gp sound of the engine with irregular bursts is too good. I remember that when I had the rt while I was doing the service a guy arrived with this tool who complained that the distribution was already rumbling at just over 7000 km. God save us and free. I have had three of bmw. The first, a s1000xr at the second exit with only 200 km and 19,500 euros spent threw me down, fortunately at a roundabout. I had lost a screw and the engine oil leaked and got into the rear wheel. Three fractured ribs. Then, waiting for me to refurbish it, because I didn't even talk about it new, I exchanged it with a r1200r that I liked but had the defect of turning off every now and then. Not to mention the RT which was a real ciofeca."
2097,"The headlight looks very similar to the gsx s1000r, large Perfetto."
2098,They will sell very few !!!! 22K euro and Marzocchi forks is crazy with laughter !!!!!
2099,"I like the bike but I prefer the xr1000, it has a little more shelter, in my opinion the bmw is number one as a tft, is it comfortable as a rider seat? I have a 2020 version tracer 900 license plate this year and I find it a bit hard, maybe I still have to get used to it, I had been standing still for 4 yearsüòÇ"
2100,"Chassis, fork, brakes worthy of a 16,000 euro bike ..... oops but this only costs 22K !!!!!!!! Not to mention the vibrations that BMW on this and the XR1000 has NEVER been able to remove !!!!!!"
2101,"The basic version from ‚Ç¨ 14800 is practically unavailable at any dealer. The bike costs over 17 thousand euros in the real world. Consumption is too high, my sd1290gt consumes less, but those who buy this bike don't care much about consumption. For the rest, a beautiful test and a wonderful bike"
2102,"I went from thunder v4 1100 2017 to s1000r 2020. Vibrations are still a problem on this bike, left footrest saddle and HANDLEBAR. Suspensions for me too hard in road mode and finally the front too sensitive on disconnections thanks to the fact that the large optical group is attached to the forks. Bad choice. Excellent engine and first brake attack too abrupt"
2103,"I just sold my S 1000 RR model year 2016 ... at 51 years old and after 35 uninterrupted years of sports bikes (and also on the track) my back and my neck are starting to send me unequivocal messages ... in the dealership to see the new XR and this R but I really think that I will buy the latter shortly ... compact, light but above all suitable for my slim build (in height at least ...) I was thrilled even when stationary. I think it is the best choice not to make me regret the sensations of the RR (priceless ...) but also without making me become the best friend of the orthopedists and physiotherapists in my area. This beautiful (and complete) test does nothing but strengthen my convictions, I just hope to be able to do a test ride sooner or later but by now ..."
2104,I haven't heard you talk about handlebar vibrations. I have read other tests (especially foreign) where many have complained defining them really annoying. Didn't you notice anything abnormal turning on the street?
2105,"Too bad for the colors and the headlight, axial pump and non-brembo brakes"
2106,Try it ... brakes much better than the new Speed ‚Äã‚Äãwith Brembo. You squeeze your testicles on the tank‚Ä¶.
2107,"You get used to electronics right away because in reality ... you don't feel it. I still own one of my first ""analog"" R1s and a latest generation SBK but they are two types of bikes that cannot be compared because they are very different."
2108,"I have already changed 3 bikes with the controls. Obviously one after the other more and more evolved. You get used to it immediately and trust it. They help you and keep you entertained. But now I have a 6-axis electronics that is making me turn the boxes. I'm tapped into every context and I'm pretty sure my superduke specimen has problems. I'm so afraid of how it behaves that I'm using it free. I unplugged everything and the bike is something else entirely, it's spectacular. Of course psychologically it's tough because 180 hp is a lot. And cornering ABS should be a plus rather than a minus. On the 30th I take it to conce but I'm afraid of that standard answer ""the bike is fine"". I am amused with the S1000R"
2109,Too bad for that anonymous headlight that confuses it with the F900.
2110,"S1000R: excellent ride comfort - has lost character - (aesthetic and dynamic) ... in practice, we are not there. We want the naked ignorant! üò©"
2111,"It costs too much for what it offers, the engine is ""limp"" compared to the old versions (even if it goes much less fun), cheap and ridiculous front calipers (even standard failures). The 2014 model was the top at the time, a dream, now it is the worst in terms of price / quality ratio of all .... BMW just wants to earn so we move on to something else!"
2112,"I have seen many tests of the S1000R, all agreed on one point only, the bike vibrates in an annoying way already from 3500 rpm"
2113,"It is a bike only for experts, or slowly almost everyone can carry it"
2114,"I just got the ktm superduke 1290R and I discarded the competition because it is the only one that has emphasized the word irrational. BMW are doing very little good (globalization and boredom), Yamaha and Honda are perhaps too Nippo, and the Italians are too noisy."
2115,I prefer the new Suzuki Gsx s1000 2021 !!
2116,Bad enough ... always better ktm Superduke ...
2117,this one in my opinion is also ugly
2118,You certainly don't turn around to look at it.
2119,"Ugly, anonymous S1000r ever seen"
2120,"They make you pay 17 thousand euros if you want on two packages and they remove the Brembo and put the axial pump ahahahaha Bmw make you laugh ""eh but the tft ..... ü§£"""
2121,A useless bike. It is not for the track; too powerful for the street; 0 aerodynamic protection. An exercise in style for repressed geeks!
2122,"I recently withdrew it, 4000 rpm up to 7500 rpm the mirrors cloud from the caz vibrations."
2123,Well done to the BMW styling department. You‚Äôve succeeded at making a mighty super naked look like a Honda Grom.
2124,I'm surprised they didn't try to figure out how to put two giant kidney grills on the face
2125,I said the same thing! In fact I even found a picture of a Grom with a suspiciously similar paint job. The headlights weren't the best or the brightest in the old design but I miss that ridiculous asymmetrical face.
2126,It looked unique before but now its looks a Japanese naked bike from 10 years ago ... Shame
2127,They failed the styling
2128,paint is garbage. Only decent (not even great) option is on the M package that you have to pay an arm and a leg extra for.
2129,"Sounds like the like the last gen Speed Triple RS to me. A really solid, predictable road bike in every way but it wasn't very exciting when compared to its rivals. I think BMW will be refreshing this gen sooner rather than later."
2130,"kind of reminds me a 2000's fireblade. More than adequate in every regard as a great road bike, but not destined to set any hearts aflame. Except that front end, thats just the most awful bland thing i've seen in a while, short of the new MT09"
2131,"I don‚Äôt care how good this is, when you open your garbage you‚Äôre going to think - I‚Äôve just spent ¬£17k on a bland boring bike"
2132,"It‚Äôs probably more down to what you want. For me this is the perfect super naked. Road, touring, the occasional pillion use and all the power I‚Äôd ever need. Not the most exciting, but a great all rounder, the sort of bike that isn‚Äôt instantly impressive but does everything well. Great TFT, heated grips and cruise control and all day usable. Probably not the right bike if you‚Äôre looking for something completely mad."
2133,"I bought an old one last year, as an experienced rider / old. Its like an original R1 or Thunderace but with motocross handlebars. And its way lighter than a ZX12R to get out of the garden. I love it"
2134,Still a potent liter bike. Wonder if a slip on exhaust would liven it up.
2135,"I have switched to the a 2021 XR that is also great, and I am sure that if sometime Motorrad decides to fit a shift cam motor to the S 1000 R , I will gladly get it again!"
2136,"i have a 22 s1k sport and it is an ABSOLUTE riot to ride. has the power when you require it. Does everything well. The brakes will sing you a song and make you real confident on the front end. I am going to put the stage 1 brentune on it. the autoblip is a shade clunky and the start idle is a tad annoying. Best piece about the bike is that when you want a nice lazy ride, it is 100% happy doing it. but when you want to go full nut bag, it turns into a flat daemon. I was going to go for the M package but realized i can do a full akra system for 1/2 the price and the wheels really didn't matter that much to me. Good luck, hope this helps someone. I will have it on the track in 3 weeks and i can't wait."
2137,I love the looks and the build of BMW bikes but I‚Äôm just too nervous of the lack of reliability and issues with them.
2138,"I test rode it and was terribly disappointed, as exciting as a day old salad. I have gone back and purchased the previous gen."
2139,I have a 2019 S1000R and really don't see the point in the new version.
2140,"I've ridden almost all of the current offering of nakeds and, in my mind, most fall under the category of streetable track bikes. The S1k is a trackable street back. If that makes sense."
2141,"Mt09 does it for me. Amazing fun even under 60mph, and it's under 10k"
2142,"""Not a great track day bike"" - what a damning statement! Tuono has officially cemented itself as the bike to get for next season!"
2143,"A really, really, really good review of a really, really, really, impressive bike. Would I buy one ?Nah, not really."
2144,"I had one it‚Äôs a brilliant bike , I‚Äôve got a new F900 R now but I miss the S1000 , it‚Äôs more fun and the engine is bliss !"
2145,"These modern bikes are a work of technological art, superb motors, over the top electronics, but i think the manufacturers need to address the visual look and style , they all resemble one another. Years back you could distinguish between the brands at a glance ,now they all look the same especially the nakeds. When we shell out our hard earned cash we want that extra special icing on the cake look, which i personally think we don't get nowadays."
2146,"in the real world, the old S1000R was exceptional. I am now kicking myself for selling it in favour of something newer."
2147,Saw one of these for the first time at the motorcycle shop a couple of weeks ago and it's a super nice bike.. but I still want a super duke the most
2148,this model was so convincingly good that i had to buy it
2149,Rode the old one to a test ride of the new one and back to back the new one has lost some of the aggression and shove at the bottom. it feels lighter and more agile but not as gutsy.
2150,I rode the original S100R sport for 13k miles and swapped it for a Ducati monster 1200R‚Ä¶the beemer didn‚Äôt sound good but it was epic fun
2151,I never would have thought I'd prefer the looks of the front on the older S1000R to this new one. Love that TFT though
2152,fingers crossed will be released M1000R with shiftcam and small finalasied things and then can compete with his rivals easily
2153,"so you can buy 3 different ones but even with m package you still dont get good adjustable suspension ? when you said the damping cant be adjusted enough and showed the marzocci fork , i remember my first panigale . that also had a marzocci front fork that was not adjustable enough . how on earth do bmw put in stuff like extra light very expencive wheels but no descent suspension . "
2154,On uk roads this bike will be as quick as anything out there and that's what counts
2155,"I can ride almost anything the same speed on the road because there is a limit to how hard you can safely and responsively ride. So how it sounds and makes you feel, it‚Äôs character is important. So I‚Äôd go for almost anything over the BMW most likely the tuono."
2156,"I like the look of the previous generation s1000r better with its asymmetrical headlights. At least it was unique, this kinda looks like a Kawasaki z125."
2157,Eliminating the shift cam tech was the dumbest thing bmw could have done... A fully naked s1000rr would have been on the top of the hyper naked list
2158,sorry but even down low and mid power the rr engine with shiftcam is better. Can't understand it why they lost the shiftcam on the r.
2159,The Tuono is the only smart one with a screen as standard which is vital with this power and speed on tap surely. For me the BMW lacks character
2160,If only I had the money. However with a 28 inch inside leg I'm totally out of the new naked. New Indian FTR though. Sounds fun for a shortie.
2161,As an s1000rr owner I was ready to buy this..but then I test rode a zh2.. I now own a zh2 üòÇ
2162,"I recently rode the 2021 BMW S1000R , 2021 Triumph Speed Triple 1200RS and 2021 Aprilia Tuono V4. The BMW is incredibly light, the one I rode had the forged wheels so it steered amazingly fast. The engine has not the performance of the Triumph nor the Aprilia but that is not an issue since it is plenty fast. The main complains for me were front end instability at high speeds and the vibrations through the bar. I could live with that. But I could never live with the soulless engine. I have never ridden an electric bike but i guess the S1000R is quite close to the sensations of an electric motorcycle. It is so bland. If you buy an 2021 S1000R you should never ride a Speed triple 1200RS or Tuono V4 because you will immediately realize you made the wrong choice."
2163,"I don't like the front end of the S1000R either. And overall it looks cheaper than the Triumph or the Aprilia. Between the Triumph and the Aprilia the 1200RS makes the 2021 Tuono V4 feel a generation old. Which it is. I own a 2013 Tuono V4R and a 2011 Speed Triple 1050. The 2021 Tuono is a refined version of my Tuono but fundamentally is the same motorcycle. The 1200RS is a completely new bike and makes my 1050 feel like a dinosaur. The 1200RS is the best bike I have ever ridden and I will buy one in the near future. I also can't understand the complains of some journalists about the confort of the 1200RS. Is a sportsbike, is firm but not uncomfortable. It is much better than the Tuono in that regard. I think you bought wisely"
2164,"The best design among the super nekad are the Kawasaki Z series )Z1000, Z900 and Z800) and the Ducati Streetfighter.. BMW doesn't have the look of a super naked."
2165,"If we could have this bike, but with a cross plane engine (a la MT-10) it would be a dream come true."
2166,Would like it with Shiftcam better.
2167,"The Exhaust pipes and catalytic converter are hideous, beyond that it looks great."
2168,"Good review. I actually preferred it to the Tuono and Speed Triple (Aprilia gearbox wasn't great, and Triumph chassis isn't as good). I scored it on a par with the KTM as a road bike. But I already have a twin, so this compliments my other bike better. Planning on ordering one before next Spring...!"
2169,"I actually like that front end, I've always liked that headlight since they put it on the r1200r and am enjoying the new styling"
2170,"I think I'm still a fan of a single headlight in general. I know it's more contemporary to have some angular dual light setup, but I think this will actually age better."
2171,I think its looks OK too. The exhaust is hideous though.
2172,Tested one the other week: feels like a docile wife vs my hot Italian mistress named Streetfighter V4
2173,"Once you ride the Tuono V4, you're ruined because everything you ride afterwards sucks. That's not to say any of the super nakeds are bad; not at all! The Tuono V4 is perfection."
2174,I find the brakes are better than the Brembos my r1250r ;-).
2175,after 2 S1000R Sports I now have a 2021 Ducati Streetfighter V4S
2176,Man these newer bikes bread boxes are getting bigger and uglier. Soon you'll be able to bake a entire loaf in one of those things. Thanks Euro 5.
2177,"S1000r is a vanilla bike, nothing wrong with that but it's been forgotten about by it's ""super naked rivals""... insignificant! Who is torn between a s1000r and a V4 Streetfighter??? Nobody! It's a bike for people clinging onto their youth, refusing to buy a GS just yet. Market for that for sure but super nakends need to be... super!"
2178,How is the turning circle compared to the previous model please? Very much improved
2179,Looks kinda bland for a Suzuki! :D
2180,"Love the review and it's pretty clear the S1000R is a decent bike... but my thought process runs along the lines of ""Why would I EVER compromise on supernaked?"" I'm just not looking for a supernaked that is ""comfortable"" and ""practical"" and I'd steer folks away from supernaked class bikes if they are (there are better options like the Multistrada, S1000XR, etc... for that). If there was any bike class that was all about excess and stupid levels of crazy, the supernaked class is it. Telling me the S1000R is practical is basically saying ""get the Aprilia"" (which we all know is NOT comfortable or practical... but IS the quintessential supernaked)."
2181,1. Superduke R 2. Tuono 1100 V4 Factory/RR 3.¬†Speed-Triple 1200RS 4. Streetfighter V4S 5. S1000R 
2182,"it looks sterile, characterless i'm sure its fantastic just looks dull"
2183,"Why BMW doesn't allow you to have the same suspension settings as the RR, I will never know. At least offer it as a paid upgrade it's just a damn software access thing. But no. Just 2 presets are good for you, sir.... ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
2184,The front of this bike just ruins the whole experience for me.
2185,"Great review Neevesy, BUT, it‚Äôs sooooooooooo bland looking on front end! Ruins the bike - shame"
2186,Even to put this question to the test is ridiculous ü§£ü§£ü§£ This is neither revolution or evolution. This bike is a plastic wannabe that doesn't even come close to the japanese inline4-s.
2187,Front looks like an old cb1000r
2188,I hate these new robocop lights.. looks like a lame robot.. The goofy eyes of the last model gave so much character..
2189,"great bike, but not very desirable."
2190,still cant find the neutral n shaky mirrors
2191,It's a nice bike but it's not better than the MT07
2192,That is a bike I would never buy. Like so many new bikes that are too complicated it is everything I want in a car and not in a bike. GSXR K5 with non of the electronics is so much better.
2193,I like naked bikes but this bike is never on my radar it doesn't look bmw enough i wish the headlight has that bmw signiture unsymmetrical headlight. Honestly put suzuki badges in it and people would believe it.
2194,That thing is fugly. I would rather ride the sharp looking CB1000R Black edition or the Tuono.
2195,"In a word, ""Nein"" I would say it's 6th in class, at best"
2196,"¬£12k or what should have been a hair over $14k US, that was a lie. Come over to the US and dealers have the base model with no options listed at $18k... OTD you're looking at over $20k, and for that much you may as well just get the Ducati V4. M package bikes are listed at $23k+, that's two MT-10's..."
2197,Thinking man's supernaked
2198,Same appeal as Honda or a hospital.
2199,2 thousand pounds just to get cruise control and a few other bits?
2200,Could it look any uglier... I mean jesus.. Looks like its a crash job.
2201,This new BMW front headlamp is ruining everything üò≠ sorry BMW
2202,the new bmw s1000RR head light with led strip is just pure satisfaction to watch but unfortunately who ever designed this bmw headlight must be fired at once üòÇ
2203,"The answer to this is a resounding NO. I've ridden it twice and based on feedback from new owners and everyone I've talked to, the comments were 'its boring'. This bike is a complete flop and can be traced back to BMW's decision to cheap out on the Shift-Cam technology. The Shift-Cam would have given it the torque and power it needed down low and in the midrange."
2204,"I tried this and even if it was a good starting point, for the same amount of money, i got me a tuono v4. Also the new Aprilia is better equipped, comes with the quickshifter stock, has windshield, has already a couple protections for carters on the sides and you can lift it from the back as soon as you come home. It was for a promo, but i couldn't resist that juicy v4 sound. Also didn't like the bmw's front lever feel, too much aggressive"
2205,That front end is fucking horrid. Nice work BMW. You actually managed to make it look like a Suzuki.
2206,U n d e r p o w e r e d
2207,"I love the color coordination of the subframe, side cover and, maybe unintentional (or intentional), the exhaust. looks really great from the side!"
2208,Love BMW‚Äôs S1000 series. The best in-line 4 engine period. A true modern marvel.
2209,Beautiful bike. I was impressed with the user friendliness of the first gen.
2210,That‚Äôs my bike! I love it. It‚Äôs a track weapon for sure and super comfortable. I did the Bren Tuning to smooth out the flat spot.
2211,"for the money there is no better super bike package (cruise control, heated grips, carbon wheels üí•) also get a 36k - 3 year warranty. A tune gets rid of all issues and adds insane power (but could cost you the warranty- if you get caught‚Ä¶ lol)"
2212,Owned a few before I moved to Ducati v4. Great bikes. Have a lot of good memories of the s1000rr. The American ones need a full system and remap. Restrictions kill it. Easy bike to ride fast and comfortable.
2213,Yeah that was pretty cool props for not comparing headlights to the old version
2214,"Years back now, I knew an Italian Lady who went from a diehard MV Brutale fan to owning a 1000rr and loving it as her daily ride. If she is still riding. I'd not be surprised if she has the latest version. She really liked the TC for riding through old cobblestone streets with no worry. Fuel mileage is one of the limiting factors for the Isle Of Man TT bikes, and BMW seems to be one that can get the most power and still get two laps from 25 liters of gas."
2215,The Shiftcam sounds like Honda's old VTEC. The power from the low rpm lobe falls off then it changes to the high rpm lobe. What some people did back in the day is use a VAFC to change the VTEC activation point to smooth out the power band a bit.
2216,I have had all 3 and RR is most fun by far. One of the comfiest suberbikes you would ever ride in anywhere.
2217,Congrats to the Bavarian Gixxer for surviving the railway-construction-oldtire-mudbowl!
2218,I had the same issue with finding neutral when the engine was running. Could only get it like you did with the bike off.
2219,"If you are average height - around 6' 3"" or taller - Tuono is an absolute no-go. It's like sitting on a broom. In that case, MT10 is for you."
2220,"I‚Äôm sure the American model has additional emission control which is causing the hole in the power delivery, as opposed to the European model. "
2221,"The flat spot in the new BMWs (and other bikes) aren‚Äôt really due to Euro5 ‚Äì the Euro bikes don‚Äôt have the flat spot ‚Äì but mostly due to EPA sound emission regulations, which are stricter than Euro. Manufacturers respond by closing the exhaust valve in lower RPM and limiting throttle/fueling in the certification testing range, among other things. I have 15K miles on my 2020 S1000RR. I got mine a bit before you did. My guess is that you would have had a different opinion and outcome had you installed the Brentuning (now BT-Moto) tune because it totally transforms the bike. It not only deletes the flat spot, but unleashes the shiftcam for more power throughout (relative to Euro), gives better sound, better fueling, better idle, quicker shifts, etc. Wow! The teething problems are also a bit overblown. Mine had recalls replacing the oil cooler and front calipers, but those were done seamlessly at the 6K and 12K services. No problems otherwise. It‚Äôs been my best purchase ever. I understand the frustration over the inability to change settings (suspension, anti-wheelie, engine braking, etc.) on the fly, but the many configurable elements require a deeper dive through TFT menus, and BMW‚Äôs Teutonic OCD wants to prevent you from changing these while moving. However, it‚Äôs mostly an initial setup annoyance, at least for a particular track, where you can set RACE PRO 1-3 with different ranges of settings you think likely good and switch between them while riding. At least BMW later issued a software update that enabled Bluetooth data telemetry to the phone app for some Data Logging capability in RACE PRO modes. I haven‚Äôt ridden the new R, but the new XR is outstanding. I think the R and XR have the same engine and tune. They improved almost everything a little bit, and that accumulates to a big overall improvement. I do have minor complaints such as the too-soft ROAD mode that makes me never to use anything less than DYNAMIC, but so what"
2222,I like the looks of the f900 although I would be hesitant to get the keyless ignition and gas lock. If that fails you can‚Äôt start the bike or get gas and being a BMW chances of that failing is high. I know that BMW overall as a brand has electrical issues as well as some parts failing rather quickly due to being made out of plastic. Still they make some great looking bikes.
2223,"First off, great detail and flow to this review, loved all the little tabs with info on them, great touch. Now the bike, I am happy they used bremo instead of the hayes (I think) that were used on the s1000rr. Is that dead spot the same even though there isn't the shift cam? Great review overall, still would take the streetfighter though...üòâ"
2224,"Thinking about purchasing this as my second bike with my R nineT as the first, also bought after watching your review."
2225,i have a Ninety and thinking of changing for this one.
2226,"You can change the suspension on the fly, you don‚Äôt have to stop. Just close the throttle briefly."
2227,"Expensive bike, expensive maintenance cost, but beautiful bike ‚ù§Ô∏èü§§"
2228,"those rear blinkers don't look too bright to me, i've noticed this on some bikes recently, always worries me that someone's gonna drive up my rear while i'm waiting to turn"
2229,"Why I bought the streetfighter better looking as well, only complaint is it not having cruise control"
2230,"Yes, (according to what my dealer told me) he said when i ordered mine, when i asked it has the exact same part number as the RR. So it should fit. (the exhaust)"
2231,I also like this too but I just don‚Äôt like in-line 4s anymore.
2232,I‚Äôm mainly looking to get a 2021/22 model. I really like the V4S but I can‚Äôt really justify 24k for it. Really like the tq number on the Superduke and that price is way more attractive. The new Tuono isn‚Äôt out yet so that we‚Äôll have to wait and see.
2233,"if I were you, wait until that new Tuono is released. Last time I checked, they made some revisions to the electronics and gave it an LED facelift (like the 660). Tuono will feel very familiar to your RSV4. Engine and everything is pretty much identical. I think the Super Duke is the most fun machine I‚Äôve ridden. That thing pulls like nothing else in the lower RPM‚Äôs. Super comfy seating position and many features. Again, can‚Äôt go wrong with either but the KTM wins for me."
2234,Really like the color scheme
2235,"Japanese and BMW Super Nekad¬†are really marvelous, with prices that are very reasonable compared to their competitions from Europe. BMW has made some design improvements that new really looks super nekad. The best design among the super nekad are the MV Agusta Dragster/Brutale and Kawasaki Z1000, Z900 & Z800, with their wide fuel tanks.. other brands do not have the look of the super naked as the fuel tanks are taken directly from their respective sport version bikes."
2236,I have a 2019 S1KR but not that impressed. Ok considering this with the M package and alloy wheels as my S1000RR replacement. Thinking that if this delivers 75% of the performance of that S1000RR I will be a happy camper.
2237,"That flat spot between 4k-6k has to be some kind of American-only emissions regulation bullshit, because no one in Europe is mentioning that..."
2238,Nice piece of tech. Still not as pretty to look at as the SFV4.
2239,"I know you have to try and put a good spin on this for Eurocycle, and you did your best, but I think BMW blew it here. When the main selling point over it's rivals is the TFT display, it almost feels like BMW gave up in this sector."
2240,"yea but often, as was the case with my friends s1000r, the rebound damping was not enough and the bike had a bounce on the front, even on dynamic setting. And no, I don't buy this preset behaviour at all. Its lazy engineering."
2241,"Suffered from it's shortest strokes of all liter bikes , flat torque low down and mid rev"
2242,"German tech what can you complaint, but still wish they could make it a bit simple thus more reliable like the Japanese did not too over engineered"
2243,"Still going keep my 2016 single R, I love the shift light the new one doesn't have it , plus the old head light looks so much better."
2244,I'm a BMW guy and waited and waited for this bike to come out. Demo'd it last weekend. It was a disappointment.
2245,Tuono V4 over this All Day
2246,Gay looking bike
2247,Weeeeeeeeeee!üèçüèçüèçgonna get one soon! Love the look!
2248,"i always try to like Suzuki bikes because I used to be a great fan of the 1990s GSX-Rs and my first bigger bike was a LS 650 Savage ... but when i see a bike with literally zero wind protection and 150 hp - I mean, can't one design anything that has a tiny little screen to deflect some of all that air that batters you when you using some of those 150 hp in 3rd or 4th gear...? and no lean sensitive ABS .... how am I goina slow down mid corner without embarrassing myself when the neighbors kid or dog runs onto the street while I turn around the corner? I'm not Marc Marquez and tech is cheap nowadays, it is standard on a dirt cheap Yamaha MT-09! lack of safety and lack of any sort of wind protection will not help Suzuki selling these although its got a gem of an engine and I'd like to have one but I'd end up using my 890 Adventure R most of the times because it offers that extra safety and a little bit of wind protection ... its just does not have an in in-line 4 Cyl motor"
2249,"It remains in Suzuki's philosophy: proven components therefore inexpensive, to make the most affordable motorcycle in its class. There is a clientele for this kind of ""first price"" motorcycles and Suzuki has decided to position itself on it. This is just my opinion, I could be wrong. It was a good video, Thanks to the whole team and see you soon. It's just fun. üòò"
2250,"I see it a bit the same‚Ä¶ the hayab and the GSR‚Ä¶ uh GSX-S, no significant innovation."
2251,this simply new plastics...
2252,One important thing you don't mention: the 19L tank! It changes us from the 12L of the Katana or the 16L of the CB 1000 (and the release of the SV650 is 1999üòâ).
2253,Too bad for the part that there is still no steering damper but cool the 19L tank. I'm waiting to see if they'll release an F model.
2254,this susuki really didn't convince me...
2255,"Good bike, nice machine, but we don't have to do with all these programs, the more there are, the less we use them"
2256,Personally I tested and to my surprise I liked it. It is really pleasant to drive. And she brakes hard.
2257,I really like this motorcycle! Can't wait to see vs compare with cb1000r! 
2258,"Good bike considering the price-performance ratio. Abs on the angle and anti-skid, lol, the average mileage of the French biker borders on 5000km/year and not in the rain, so is it really useful?"
2259,"For my part, I prefer a torquey 4-cylinder with which I can wind without having to play with the gears, even if there is the shifter, rather than the 2 and 3 cylinders. For the style, I would have preferred it with a pretty round ""angel eye"" type headlight and up-to-date instrumentation"
2260,"it's really warmed up, when you look at Suzuki's car range, it's the same story, what a pity. "
2261,Luckily we still have the second-hand market... ü§î Because what they've been trying to sell us for a while so so... ü§™
2262,"A little com to give my opinion on the look, I'm not a fan at all, especially the front. Also the atrocious exhaust lines as well (just my opinion). I hope she at least sounds good? It's not my cam, but hey, I'm more Bonneville, Bullet 500 and company, so inevitably ;) I completely agree on the fact that I would like to find fun at Suzuki, not + electronics or power, but fun, and also models equivalent to the Himalayan for example, but in twin cylinder. Just such an example."
2263,"For me 150hp is already WAY too much for my almost exclusively travel use. It may seem strange, but for me the medium displacement and ""small"" powers are ideal for that. Because less wear of consumables, possibility of finding tires that are not only ""semi-slick"", consumption, and less fatigue to manage it, etc... V to all."
2264,I look forward to this little comparison Cb1000r Vs Gsx-s 1000 ‚úå
2265,"Personally, I think it's a good machine."
2266,Magnificent motorcycle. ABS on the corner?? üòÇ you brake before no .. usb it adds up. He doesn't like 4 cylinders or simple 4 cylinder things ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è long live the ultra cl√°sico
2267,"I've had this gsxs in black since yesterday, the seat is nicer than the 2020 version and the sound is great ü§™"
2268,"Excellent summary: it does the job. But actually, the mid-size roadsters do the same for less. Can't wait for the 1100 rebel. I tried it "
2269,I was a big Suzuki fan before 1992.. since then I feel like they've been sleeping. At the same time I like old motorcycles.. an opportunity to buy a new one!
2270,"I don't see the problem at all with the fact that an engine is of old design if it is good, the engine of my last generation SV is much nicer for my taste than that of the mt or the Z650, even if it is a little worse than on the old SVs. If it works why change? There have been no major technical engine innovations in the past 20 years."
2271,150 CV for a roadster is already monstrous. 90% of bikers have neither the level nor the possibilities to use these machines (off the circuit) This race for nags for everyday motorcycles is stupid.
2272,"Nice your analysis that hits the mark! What's difficult when you see the new Suzukis is that you want to go on the second-hand market. Why bother to take this gsx when the old model does as well? (Even the 2005 R) Same for the good old SV 650. Very good used bike! As you mentioned, if you want a torquey and dynamic motorcycle there are plenty of good bikes, if you want something ""old-fashioned"" there may be better neo-retros in this segment. (Cb1100, pure nineT, z900rs). To want to make a cheap and basic 1000. We find ourselves caught up by the segment below!"
2273,"In my humble opinion, Suzuki has cut all the development budgets on the thermal engine models to concentrate everything on a revolutionary prototype of a Euro 12 compatible rotary engine, running on green algae juice and developing 280hp/litre. Or are they really in trouble? Joking aside, the 2015 model was super fun to drive, but this one doesn't seem to add anything, in a segment that is losing momentum. The boss of Suzuki France is definitely not JCO..."
2274,"Aesthetically the Japanese are not really accomplished: the European ones are much more beautiful. This is a totally subjective opinion on my part because beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But personally, the first criterion when I buy a motorcycle is reliability...so Japanese. I dream of a European-designed motorcycle with Japanese reliability...but you can't have it all, can you?"
2275,"Owner of a 2018 gsxs 1000 I confirm the feeling, old-fashioned engine, to be shortened, it can be a bit bland motorcycle. I paid mine 8800 with 6000 km I would not have bought it new. The big quality of this bike compared to mt09 KTM 890 and even mt10 (all tried) c stability, it's a reassuring bike on the angle (like the 750) not too agile, you can feel the gsxr frame underneath and very good ground clearance too. "
2276,"I have a hard time imagining that they will succeed in selling it properly. It's aesthetically outdated, wonky, and technically out of step with its pseudo-modern look."
2277,"When will there be a real novelty at Suz...!?üôÑ Everything is said, I had an 800DR and a 1100 GSX-R and these machines made us dream and not expensive...!!!ü§© But today then that the other brands are giving us new products with a vengeance, nothing... even the Hayabusa, magnificent but back to the future...!!!ü§î Today, it's hard to stop at their place because the The offer is not generous and does not make you dream...!!!üòû Can't wait for the renewal if it comes one day...!!?üôèüèçÔ∏è A big ‚úåÔ∏è to all the enthusiasts üòé‚úåÔ∏è"
2278,It's a pity that the screen/lighthouse assembly isn't super nice.... too timid as an evolution!
2279,"Suzuki when will the return of an sv1000? With the 1050 euro5 block it should have made sense, on the weight side we could even have a few things lighter than the gsx-s. It would be more relevant for the road. Exit the gsx-s, we keep the katana"
2280,"a motorcycle that does the job without passion without fault... Personally, I prefer the Katana üòé"
2281,I prefer the fazer 1000 for its small fairing and its passenger handles. My fazer 600 protected well from the wind
2282,"I prefer my Katana, aesthetically, even with its faults, and that's also the opinion of my friends... Now, it's true that the new one has the shifter (well! that doesn't prevent me from living not not have one..), on the other hand you do not mention the fact that it is equipped with an electronic accelerator, and that is essential, because the jerks of injection, it is really a wound on the old model, and the Katana! That's really a plus. On the other hand, the counter, I confirm that it is old-fashioned, not very well done, and readable correctly only in gray weather or at night... Suz, they are really picking up, question new models!"
2283,A fun bike for me
2284,"The 650 katana... I dream of it... A place is already reserved in the garage next to the 650 XJ... For the gsx-s 1000... Well, for the duo it looks to be dead, I don't see how to install the luggage room to go on vacation... It looks like a GSXR mounted on the street after a crash... In short .. I remain nostalgic for the 1100 gsxg and bandit"
2285,"If we're not going to look for the horses at the very top, what exactly is its interest compared to the Z900, MT09, 890 all cheaper, lighter (KTM and Yam) and which have almost as much torque and lower in the range, and for some much better equipped and suspended (890R, Mt09SP)? In fact, this bike has its ass between two market segments, and no real argument to win."
2286,"Yes old design, but already proven"
2287,"so frankly I have a hard time knowing which one is the most successful. I really don't like these styles. But as we always say, tastes and colors..."
2288,Offer us beautiful objects. 150hp. Who uses them? Make us beautiful comfortable motorcycles without sick electronics and not too expensive
2289,"Suzuki voted the most boring motorcycle brand of the decade... 600 bandit, SV650, 750 GSXR... but today, they are all brain dead..."
2290,I agree with you for a while Suzuki it is exceeded BUT QUESTION COLOR THEY ARE VERY STRONG THERE WILL BE NO EVOLUTION OVER 5 YEARS BY THE COLORS SUZUKI HAVE DONE RECYCLING (THEY WILL RELEASE A GSXS 950 ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î ü§î IN A2 WHERE IS THE INTEREST FOR 2022 IF IT'S TO MAKE AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE 1000 IF THAT'S IT I BUT IT IN FULL) IN A nutshell I'M FAN OF SUZUKI SINCE MY FIRST MOTORCYCLE 600 GSXR 1998 FOR A VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED MOMENT I COME TO KAWASAKI Z900 full üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ to say there is nothing yet at Suzuki
2291,"The aesthetics indeed it's subjective. As much as I did not like the new MTs at all, for example, or the new Monster, I find this Gsxs successful. With a few accessories we can make a very nice machine I think. After that, it's sure that perf level,"
2292,"Frankly I find the old lighthouse prettier, the sound is a copy of the MT."
2293,"Suzuki could have been a hit almost 10 years ago with the Recursion prototype, a twin turbo. But what happens to them? Being MotoGP world champion is cool and I'm the first to follow the races with pleasure, but frankly they could finance a new model every year with this money. Returning to a Suzuki dealership in 21 is sad, I did it two months ago for the overhaul of my Aprilia: not a demo GSXR (euro 5 they told me), like what is the use of the GP, an SV, a Hayabusa, the trails and this gsxs. Besides, I extend the comparison a little with all the other Japanese, Honda, for 10 years, in real nine: the Africa twin and the fireblade, the rest is warmed up, Kawa, the H2 range is a real novelty, the rest, warmed up. You look at the Europeans, it's moving, KTM has evolved, Aprilia or Guzzi the same, BMW and Triumph don't talk about it, Ducati too but it's debatable. Is it EU standards that bother them and demotivate them, making our EU market the last wheel of the carriage? They no longer believe in thermals and refuse to invest? That leaves me forbidden this non-evolution of the ancient giants."
2294,"150 hp more than enough?? I would say it's too much already :) Bug but what do you want to do on our road with 150 hp?? Aside from losing your license, killing yourself or killing someone obvious?"
2295,"Well..., for the aesthetics, it's debatable... not even an engine shoe worthy of the name!!!... The only two positive points: an up/down shifter and a 20 L rez√©. for the rest ""move around, there's nothing to see"" !!!....No, frankly, I prefer the aesthetics of my 2019 model !!!...As far as daily life is concerned, it's a motorcycle carefree (10000kms/year in 2019) to ride everywhere, solo,...(.and even as a duo over short distances). Personally, I redid the map, because it was originally too lean, now with the right ratio, it's much more pleasant, no more jolts at a certain speed. What I didn't appreciate at all about this bike was its ABS!!!.. and its front braking. in attack mode, it becomes really dangerous when it starts to trigger during hard braking at the entrance to a hairpin!!! .. hence mounting avia hoses. special ABS and MC. Brembo PR 19 Corsa Corta, and there, by some miracle, no more problems... it's still an affordable motorcycle to have fun, now if you want more, you have to put your hand in the money holder, to hit the top of the range at the competition."
2296,"150hp on a roadster what's the point? we already have plenty of them at 130km/h which must use 25hp... On the other hand, a clutch lever that is not adjustable for 13000 euros......... The problem with suzuki is that they have only lived on the gsxr and they can't get out of it"
2297,"I think that this motorcycle must be very valiant with this engine. I had tried the katana and I liked it. I will try it and why not consider it later. 1,1000 for this price plus 1 design that evolves from the previous gsx s and 1 19-litre tank. Tt it doesn't seem bad to me tt"
2298,The absolute sadness this wheel!
2299,The old one was really more beautiful‚Ä¶ I love Suzuki but that's nonsense
2300,I don't find it bad in black.
2301,"Not a bad bike, but when you have ‚Ç¨13,000 to spend on a roadster you don't take that, please, you have the 890 Duke R for less."
2302,The front is ugly it looks like a cover is missing
2303,"Why buy this when you can have a 09 guaranteed abs sensations on the tft angle etc... For less expensive... And the aesthetics are easy to change, the rest a lot less. For me this gsx s 1000 has only the name, it is largely outdated."
2304,"I pity the Suzuki dealers with such a range of motorcycles!! how to make ""new"" with the old.. after a while it doesn't work anymore and it's the fall in sales year after year .... I still can't understand Suzuki's business strategy!!!"
2305,"Beware of this wheel for everyday use. The maintenance is every 6000 km and it costs a cou****. Iridium spark plugs for an everyday millstone, moreover with a 2005 engine... it stings"
2306,"too expensive, it's worth 10,000 more abs delay, outdated electronics, cheap shock absorber which is dropped when the road is bad, lack of ground clearance, 3,000 more GSXR"
2307,"Not to mention perf or technology but only aesthetics, but what goes through their heads to these Japanese designers? But what a horror this thing especially this filthy KTM-style headlight. And it's not an anti Suz com since I ride a Suz."
2308,"In short, nothing new, ugly look to look like ""like at Yam with the MT"", no technical audacity, electronic pixie dust, no puns ... another ""oven"" at Suzuki (though I've been riding Suz for 30 years ...). V"
2309,"In vertical optics in my generation we find the Ducati 999, it is beautiful but what a flop... In short!"
2310,Really weird this before...
2311,Who is waiting for this motorcycle? Nobody
2312,"they just took the old model, threw some crappy electronics inside with a makeover. they should have at least released it with the engine of the current gex and a real tft.. the old model is downright classier."
2313,You forgot the 2 front lights badged Wish...
2314,It is ugly this poor motorcycle I prefer a Katana.
2315,A new motorcycle with vibrations üëé and there are some who buy ok ü§Æ
2316,"It's ugly, I don't like it."
2317,Personally I don't like
2318,ugly motorcycle
2319,It literally made me want to buy it
2320,"Good moped, good report. To be honest, 150 hp is absolutely enough for me and I don't need all the electronic bells and whistles. How on earth did we ride mopeds before? I think the Suzi and the engine are great."
2321,"Nice review. And a nice further development of a proven basis that doesn't need to hide. I find the 19 liter tank very nice and in terms of tires the Roadsmart 3 or the Road Attack4 could mitigate the tipping, because at least the predecessor scurries around the corner with them in a fairly neutral way. I'm missing three things: Standing noise, rear suspension still on the tight side and has the hydraulic ratio of the front brake been changed (keyword 2-finger brake)?"
2322,"I think it's really crazy that you almost have to apologize for 150 hp. I had the prequel and it was insane how the prequel goes. From 0 to 100 or 200, she doesn't have to hide from anyone"
2323,"This new GSX-S1000 is practically the pragmatist among naked bikes, at a very good price. Actually, Suzuki is very often underestimated. They have great technicians and engineers. See MotoGP 2020. I think the overall package of this bike will appeal to many riders aside from the looks. I would most likely compare them to the Honda CB 1000 R, since the two are also in the same league in terms of price. Those who want lots of 'bells and whistles' will have to look elsewhere. The bike has everything it takes to savor the essence of riding. I'm looking forward to a test drive! üëç"
2324,"Top motorcycle at a top price and everything you need and apparently works well. And the 19l barrel is awesome if you like to drive further. I still don't quite understand the pillion seat, there is always this cover on it as in the video. Is it included as standard or not, or is it not a cover? I would be interested"
2325,"This time the Suzuki virtues well worked out... üëç Vauli... Reliability üëç Customer friendliness üëç Value for money üëç Accessibility üëç Practical functionality üëç Proven, mature technology üëç True values ‚Äã‚Äãüëç"
2326,"Nice review, even if I only ride a 48, I think 152hp and 106Nm on a naked bike are more than enough to be fast on country roads. Not too much technology frills also very good, riding a moped should be safe, but puristic mmn. I think the Suzi brings everything you need at a fair price. Is a round thing the bike."
2327,Find them very successful. For me it looks like a mixture of Duke and the new Yamaha MT series and fortunately not orange or black and red. Suzuki colors are awesome! Thanks for a sovereign test and a high-quality video. Vauli always delivers.
2328,But it would also look really good in red (or black and gold) ü§î
2329,"finally a manufacturer dares to leave out the whole curve SOS nonsense !! RESPECT !! Display, completely OKAY if you want to play tablet games, you should sit on the couch with a 10-inch thing...."
2330,"I'm already thinking about replacing my Gixxer K4 with this one next season, what a great part, I think it's good too, I have to say that they don't put so much frills in it, and keep it simple and inexpensive üëçüèª"
2331,"according to all three reports and all your impressions, the Suzuki is already ahead, not least because of the unbeatable price. Personally, I don't necessarily need the technology that depends on the angle of inclination. But then you save almost 5000 EUR to the Speedy or a reasonably fully equipped S1000R. Also, I believe the GSX provides the most relaxed ergonomics of the three machines. With the 19 liter tank and the handlebars moved closer to the driver, great short trips should be possible without any problems."
2332,Nice motorcycle!
2333,For me at least a really great bike. I definitely see myself as a prospective buyer. üëçüëç
2334,"Great video, honest words, must buy immediately‚ö†Ô∏èüëçüèªü•∞"
2335,Suzukis are always bitched about being backwards. I like Suzuki precisely because everything is in it that you need - but all the bells and whistles that you don't need but don't have to pay for otherwise and I don't have to throw money out for any frills.
2336,"Exactly Don't lose sight of the essentials is what ZEN says What this SUZUKI offers is enough Everything that comes after is nothing more than an arms race Stuff that you didn't need before and certainly don't need now Why do you have to connect your cell phone to the motorcycle That's nonsense Now there's also a grill that you can connect to your cell phone Then your cell phone will tell you when your steak is ready Hello?! They're on drugs My father drives an ancient BMW It has absolutely nothing on board Is it fun? Oh yeah I like the display on this SUZUKI too Compared to other displays on some ridiculously expensive Italian SuperBikes with 1 million setting functions, it's simple and clear SUZUKI has understood ZEN Other manufacturers obviously less so It's the same in automotive engineering In brand new luxury cars you now have to study the operating instructions for an hour just to start driving What should you do? life is complicated enough as it is"
2337,"you can't drive, period. I am now driving my third 1000 S and am very satisfied. I don't have and won't jerk, but if you drive like an old grandfather at 3000 rpm in 6 gears, it could be, but keep practicing :) ."
2338,"A top piece with a top design. Has everything you need for hunting. And if you want more, you have to dig deeper into your pocket. And if you can drive and know the Suzuki engine, you know that you don't need more power for the other opponents. A great video üëç"
2339,"I think I got the general feeling you have for the new GSXS1000. It' sounds like it's a pretty good naked liter bike and the new look is outstanding. Though it isn't in the same power league as the super nakeds, it's still a powerful liter bike and now much smoother and still fun to ride? Suzuki motorcycles have always been great handling bikes. I had a GS1100 EX from yesteryear - not great handling but then again it was back in 1981. Techonolgy is way better today. Vielen Dank f√ºr die gute Bewertung. I speak a little German but the auto translater helped. Can't wait to see it in the States. Not supposed to be in the Suzuki showrooms until the fall of 21?? Production/Marketing screw up bc how can they miss the summer selling season? Though I think the pandemic has really messed with supply of most all new products."
2340,"I don't think the Suzi's are bad either, I used to have several Suzi's 600 Bandits; 1200 bandit, etc. This one is visually successful. Today, however, I drive the Bavarian competition."
2341,Looks like a good bike. But I would do without QS and 27Ps and go for the Z900. Another 2500-3000 euros less and the performance is enough. And it looks better too üòÅ
2342,"Bravo Suzuki , exactly the right move . Price / performance top."
2343,nice bike i like suzuk
2344,"In terms of price, other manufacturers should take an example."
2345,Looks even better than the previous model :)
2346,Nice motorbike. Looks a lot better than the Yamaha MT-09 for example. The price/performance ratio at Suzuki is always right! And 150 hp is more than enough.
2347,"What do you mean by ""It's a matter of feeling""? Related to the throttle response of the ""old"" GSX-S 1000? If so: There are many experiences and reports about the rough throttle response and noticeable load changes of the ""old"" GSX-S, even from 1000hp in a video from the last few years. I can confirm this myself, as I recently drove an ""old"" GSX-S test and noticed this as well. It would be really cool if ride-by-wire and the different riding modes eliminated this problem on the ""new"" bike, because I personally found the bike really awesome, but the load changes were very tiring when riding."
2348,"according to your experience, is the throttle response still as nervous as the old one, or has it gotten better with the ride-by-wire? When the gas tap was closed and opened, the old one caused enormous load changes and a lot of unrest in the chassis. Thanks in advance. It is also objectively a problem and not uncommon at all. A lot of people fix it with ECU reprogramming, DynoJet, Throttle off Katana. I've ridden many 4 cylinder bikes and this was horrible compared to the others, it was the only reason I didn't take the bike after a test ride. The problem is so generally recognized that I only had to write one sentence to 4 different tuning companies and they knew exactly what to do. I put my question directly to Vauli as I know a lot of people see it as a ""character"". Hopefully Vauli can answer if the throttle grip is less harsh."
2349,Magnificent!!
2350,Nice moped and value for money...I like it
2351,"I'm not a fan of Naked, but that all sounds round and appropriate üëå"
2352,"So 152 hp are actually more than enough for me... drives well, looks good - what more could you want?"
2353,Awesome bike! I bought it on 12/22/21. In grey
2354,The chopped carbon parts are sexy üëçüèª
2355,"Wow. The price is really a killer argument. Nobody needs these electronic gimmicks. Nice to have, but not a must have."
2356,Great bike.üôÇ
2357,A fantastic machine.
2358,"The rear also has too much black plastic for me, but otherwise: Chapeau, Suzuki! That's all it needs, except for cornering ABS!"
2359,"The stationary noise is really no longer irrelevant. With the 95db, Tyrol has certainly set an anchor for imitators (and they will come). I really like them, but I don't get warm with the front. You have to see it live"
2360,I find the mini lamp extremely ugly and too small for a 1000! In the dark it could be an e-bike!!
2361,"I thought the first GSXS was super awesome, but only the naked one. I also like the current bike a lot and will find its buyers."
2362,"I've been driving the GSXS-1000 for 3 years and I have to say I don't share the opinion from a purely visual point of view, but tastes differ. What I like is the shift assistant - I'd really like that. For anyone who is considering buying one (seat position, engine, handling hasn't really changed anything) this is a motorcycle with which you can go long tours without any problems. During a 2-3 week holiday I ride it every day and when I'm back home I'm back on it after a few hours. It never gets boring or painful. For me it's a bit like the egg legend woolly milk sow if it should exist. Regulates at 240 but it really couldn‚Äôt be faster because you‚Äôre blowing off the bench with the tip of your nose onto the tank, which doesn‚Äôt help much with that either."
2363,I find the radiator cover a bit too dominant. But you can work with foil. Otherwise all around optically very successful üëå
2364,"was able to watch and listen to the GSX-S 1000 live and in color (black) today. The impression, geometry (1.72 cm), sound, optics ... fits perfectly. At the price ... madness. Is now my number 1!"
2365,I like the front a lot.
2366,"Well, the lamp is not mine"
2367,"For the price you can't really say anything against the model, but I would like Suzuki to release a premium version of the Katana :) With the current GSX-R engine, the finest chassis."
2368,"The digital speedometers are really not to my liking, I would pay thousands more for a Hayabusa analog speedometer, that's a great solution there"
2369,Nice redesign Suzuki GSX-S1000
2370,"Finally a Suzuki with an exhaust that is acceptable in size, the other exhausts on the Suzukis were the size of a drainpipe."
2371,"If you want to ride a bike and really want to experience it then I think the GSX S 1000 is the best machine. I am allowed to drive several makes, all of which are great. With this product, however, the driver is still in demand.üëçüëç"
2372,I like the look of the moped very much.
2373,"Awesome bike! Engine, optics, P/L ... hit the mark! Cons: 96db stationary noise, LC display and missing cornering ABS are unfortunately a no-go in 2021! With other manufacturers already standard in the middle class. I would rather have paid 500 EUR more! Incomprehensible because the technology already mentioned is already available in the group and is installed in other models. It's a shame, I would have gotten it right away. Nothing with us again, Suzuki :-("
2374,"The ideal bike for old school, unfortunately the kickstarter is missing, if that's not enough, you might find your luck with the competition. üòÉ"
2375,Nobody needs more. Great motorcycle.
2376,very nice moped. good video. Thank you
2377,I like the design much more than the new MT series from Yamaha...
2378,"A very interesting bike, but if Suzuki actually uses the price as a way of sacrificing safety, then that is extremely shabby. At BMW you can choose this as an additional package. Not with Suzuki? That annoys me anyway with all motorcycle manufacturer sites. At BMW, I can click together the motorcycle I want and firstly see what extras are available and secondly what it costs if I have it installed directly. BMW has been offering this on their website for years. Other motorcycle manufacturers, at least those that come into question for me, seem to have some catching up to do."
2379,If it wasn't for the front üò©
2380,"130hp are enough, electronics is a gimmick. So great bike!"
2381,"I really like it, although optically nothing comes close to the Streetfighter for me. Tuono V4 Standard is also quite interesting. Don't miss the performance and the technology at all. Would be my 3rd Suzuki üòÖ"
2382,"Nice chair and attractive....I think it's a shame that the passenger is no longer properly included in this category....because I like bikes like this and I don't want to switch to enduro on such a trip because of passenger operation üòâ... .I like large-volume chairs where there is plenty of torque üòâ,... that's why I still like my converted oldie chair 1200 Bandit....üòâ"
2383,Nice bike. But it should have actually had a TFT. That can't cause a big price increase. Getting rid of all the electronic packages is also a good thing. That's what Yamaha did with the Tenere 700. Weight and price have to go down.
2384,"Absolutely cool bike. I just don't like how cowardly the Japanese have become in terms of design. I'm not expecting any Streetfighters or Panigale at all, nothing aggressively angular without compromise like the SuperDuke or sweeping like MV. But when did the last really radically ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù Japanese bike come along? The eye-catcher. Suzuki was top around 2005, but that's how their motorcycles look to this day, Kawa is getting uglier from series to series. How I loved my '09 z750! Today, everyone looks forcedly angular, but without any line. Similar to Honda! Yamaha has modernized one of the most beautifully, but unobtrusively. Suzuki does a lot right here, thoughtful improvement, good price. praiseworthy! But where is the courage to really hit it again? You used to be the benchmark!!!"
2385,"Somehow the most meaningful and likeable naked bike for a long time. It has been changed where it is more fun for the driver with QS+Blipper - against which the TC speaks nothing in this performance class - superfluous gimmicks have been dispensed with and it remains affordable and no fancy or moon prices are called. Anyone with a little experience can understand the argument about performance and manages to keep up with everything. Yes, you can be proud of it. The blue and especially the rims in the color are just beautiful. Well done Suzuki."
2386,"With all the shit that apparently has to be built into a motorcycle (!) these days in order to be able to sell it, it's a dream bike and wonderfully ""puristic"". If I had to buy a new bike, it would be this GSX-S 1000. And to everyone who thinks you need all that crap (apart from normal ABS, that's ok): if you go motorcycling, you're on your feet 2 wheels and control a driving machine with your posture - please don't fall into the delusional belief that there is any electronics in this world that would do that for you (except maybe the self-driving GS from BMW) - and that's exactly why you want to go motorcycling. ... All those who really want to have all this electronic shit: Play a Playstation, XBox or whatever console, but stay away from public traffic, you are a danger to yourself and to others."
2387,"The front looks very similar to the MT 07, a minus for my taste"
2388,Isn't the ultra ugly mini funzel unworthy of a 1000er!!
2389,"Suzuki is simply there with a good approach, don't pack unnecessarily with technology, but it works and the price-performance ratio is right. What more do you want."
2390,"What is Suzuki building? Motorbikes, very simple. And no overbred riding monsters stuffed with electronics, which I think is overkill, at least for a naked bike. I'd like to fire around in a tense posture with tunnel vision, at a super sports car like a gas patient. And I don't think it lacks 30-50 hp. What for? What is all this electronic frills for, so that in the end I have to pay almost 20,000 for a motorcycle? Guys, for a motorcycle! If you want that and want to put something like that in the display case because you only miss one when you look at it, or to brag about it to your buddies/colleagues, you're welcome. Suzuki, done right, keeps making bikes for bikers, thanks. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüèçÔ∏è"
2391,"The ""lamp"" can hardly be surpassed in terms of ridiculousness, embarrassment and ugliness!! It looks like an e-scooter or a 50's is coming!! A 1000er needs proper lighting and not such a tiny dim light! Don't be surprised if you are given the right of way, oncoming traffic thinks a small, slow vehicle is coming and may underestimate its speed!! I wouldn't buy the bike with the lamp/mask, even if the bike is really good!! Responsible ""designers"" put 6-!!! Tip: always stop first then get off!!"
2392,"I like the look of it, but in my opinion Suzuki made too many excuses ""because of the price"". The competition is simply better at that and I only had Suzukis for 15 years. Anyone looking for a naked bike for the country road will do better with the Z900. 3000 ‚Ç¨ cheaper and has e.g. B. a TFT color display, smartphone connection and all the modern stuff. Of course it is 27PS and only 7NM less, but these are also 1500 rpm more. Much more important to me on the country road. I don't think they take much in everyday life. If the 27PS are worth 3k extra charge, you can access it. competitive price? With the partly outdated technology, probably not."
2393,"Ride by wire is real progress. My gsx-s1000f jumps and tears at the slightest twist on the throttle grip, constant driving jerks and load changes included. A very choppy bike that takes getting used to. However, I think the design is a disaster. The headlight and the bulky cockpit seem totally inhomogeneous. The old one was prettier and slimmer. Is there a disguised S version of the new one?"
2394,I am currently driving a GSX-R1000 K5 and am seriously considering switching to the new GSX-S1000.
2395,"The new 1000 is beautiful, but it's a big ship. This new design applied to the gsxs 750 would be a real statement! If it stayed below 9000 euros I would buy it immediately. Nice and handy, old school and still modern. And the soundscape, just a dream. But from what I've heard, the 750 falls victim to the Euro 5. Hopefully suzuki will think about it again. That would be an affordable bike with a real fun factor for the masses."
2396,The light mask is a little too narrow otherwise the thing looks awesome
2397,"Looks like a Chinese copy of a Super Duke. But if the price is right, it's definitely okay. But there will probably be only a few who say: ""This is my dream bike"". And when you then see what discounts there are on the Super Duke or how little an s1000r ultimately costs, then the customer base becomes a bit thin. And if you don't place such high value on performance anyway, but on driving fun, then I can get an 890 Duke R for even less money."
2398,"the whole thing is so strange :D But in general, nice evolution"
2399,"I don't think you understand my whole argument, because basically we're pretty much of the same opinion. The only point of criticism was that the GSX-S 1000 basically does not throw anything really special into the ring and that the avoidable price argument also has little weight in view of the loss in value. That doesn't mean it can't exactly suit your tastes or someone else's."
2400,The sound with the original system was very sonorous and much better than I got from a 4 cyl. would have expected (come from the 3 cyl.)
2401,"We don't need new bikes being developed from scratch all the time. So I like the concept of this bike. However, I personally don't like the front. Would choose the 1000s as a katana"
2402,I recently drove the 750s - really great and I'm looking forward to the 1000s. What I don't understand is that all manufacturers still use the ugly standard license plate holder including the giant turn signals. For barely 100‚Ç¨ more you could make it sportier right away.
2403,"All in all a nice bike, but somehow I find that the light masks on many new bikes (Mt-07,09 and this one) are really not nice."
2404,Suzuki probably ran out of budget and/or taste for the lamp.
2405,Everything a moped needs. If it were still nice and came from Italy ü§£ü§£ü§£ Price in Austria is too expensive due to our Nova. 13000 is ok
2406,"But I don't know I can do anything with the thing. I personally don't like the mask at all and the shape of the tank. I can't get used to it, because I liked the design of the predecessor better. Compared to the z1000 I would take the Kawa."
2407,Good value for money
2408,"I sold my ""old"" one after 14 months because of constant jolting (despite 2 software updates). If the ""new one"" doesn't have that flaw...she's mine."
2409,"I don't really know... Visually, at least from the side, a bad Superduke knock-off. Tank, side panels and rear look very much like an SD fake... Too bad Suzuki..."
2410,"Apart from the Suzuki, only the Tuono and the Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple seem to be able to shift down under load. Why? I actually use this feature all the time."
2411,"Well, I do not know. The current light masks are all ugly.... Otherwise nice motorcycle!"
2412,150 hp are enough.
2413,"I have the previous model, the new one is pretty except for two things, the spoiler below is missing, that makes the old one look nicer and I don't like the light in front, but otherwise a really nice bike"
2414,They have really great engines but how on earth can I sell a motorcycle without a clear coat seal???? But the cheap price has to come from somewhere
2415,"This is the most beautiful naked Kilogixxn ever, maybe a little more neon yellow would be nice. But then the foiler also has a little work to do! ;-)"
2416,The previous one was much nicer
2417,Awesome bike
2418,"If I hadn't bought the neo sports CB1000, I would almost have gotten the Suzuki by now...I love my Honda. I would like this Suzuki for my girlfriend or best Hawara. Then I'm happy for you :-"
2419,"15,000??? The predecessor cost about 12,000 (list). First of all, it's not worth 3000‚Ç¨ more and secondly, you almost get a tuono for the money. We'll see what it actually sells for. No one takes them for 15,000. 12500 would be realistic for the thing. And then talk about a ""good price"". It's ridiculous"
2420,"I'm a self-confessed Suzuki fan, the price is certainly high, but it's still too fat and too good. More of a roadster than a really aggressive naked ala Tuono etc"
2421,the suzukis were probably euro9 compliant 5 years ago
2422,"if i'm honest, i like it better than the predecessor with its gigeresque teardrop design. the mask was also cruel to look at. as if salvator dali had drawn a hasbro transformer. the rear seat is definitely a real source of joy - it's a pity that horvath wasn't there for the pillion test...that would have been a picture for gods. once again an exuberant portion of nested subordinate clauses and verbal filler material...Mr. Vielhaber must have been in a good chatting mood. the only question that arises is why all this sounds as if there is not much new to report, but it has to inflate so much that in the end it is not just the new look that is worth mentioning. it all started so well: a well-managed evolution based on an engine that was simply too good to be further developed and thus possibly made worse? everything that came after that almost sounded like an apology. :D :D :D why? because of the lack of groundbreaking innovation? in what form should it come with such an exhausted concept without losing the long-established customer base who actually appreciates these virtues? I think it's ok that the 150 hp are considered sufficient. why invest in so much extra performance, which i then have to keep in check with complex and equally investment-intensive electronics, so that the widowmaker doesn't wipe out more rulers than an existing epidemic? only because of the regular table weight? at the moment it's negligible anyway, given the few gastro opening days a year. ;-) for me suzuki did it right. ps and yes - I like it when the vauli has to suffer...it's almost like a carwash... :D :D :D"
2423,"The passenger roll in the video is an accessory and probably not intended to actually take a passenger with you. The engine has once again received new camshafts and should therefore have a smoother torque curve without dents in the lower and middle speed range (see Suzuki website). For this, 2 Nm were sacrificed at the tip. Suzuki test riders claim you can drive the new one a gear higher than the old one with the same suit. It would have been nice to know whether she still walks like the old one, but unfortunately there were no statements from Vauli. And they even had the old one with them..... But no, let's concentrate on the regulars' table values...."
2424,You can no longer recognize the bikes from afar with these small headlights. See also yamahaa new mt 07 etc. ... Eig dangerous something like that
2425,"Certainly not a bad bike, but where are the real innovations from Suzuki? The bottom line is that we've been seeing the same bikes warmed up lukewarm for years. It's a shame, Suzi can actually do it better."
2426,Unfortunately not my case :(
2427,Just because of the ridiculous lamp mask with mini light I would not want to own the thing!! Too bad actually!
2428,Optics somehow bland and a weng copied from Yamaha. The transformation is getting boring...
2429,Katana still looks better üòé
2430,"Upper class naked bikes and still LC display. Typical Suzuki. Honestly, I was hoping that Suzuki would sharpen the GSXS 1000 again.. Better response, less weight and LED lights. That would have been enough for me with the price. But with this ride by wire and the riding modes, I didn't fall off my chair. Blipper and larger fuel tank (new 19l !!) are a big plus."
2431,"So the reviewer wasn't able to make a direct comparison to the predecessor in terms of throttle response, but since he didn't complain, I assume that the load change shock from ""throttle up"" when applying the power has become negligible. She probably got LED light. Less weight would always be good, but how is that possible if the frame, swingarm and drivetrain remain the same?"
2432,"The problem is that the engines have to run very lean, so the response suffers. And not every manufacturer managed to do that right away. Why Suzuki positions the bike like this you have to ask Suzuki. I would also add 500 EUR for an IMU, but I don't always get what I want either."
2433,"The Streitfighter optics are not my cup of tea. Fortunately, there is now the GT version for that. That would be something for me. I got along without electronic gimmicks in 40 years. ABS has its right to exist. I do not care about the rest. If you need electronic driving aids with the 70 permitted almost everywhere....but it's a free country and everyone can be talked into what they want. But my Bandit won't break even without driving aids. Too bad they kinda screwed up the katana..."
2434,"The new GSX S 1000 doesn't work at all . Technically it's great, just like its predecessor and it doesn't really matter whether you wrap yourself around the tree with 150, 170 or even 200 hp. But the optics!!! I don't know what Suzuki was thinking with the design. It looks like a castrated katana, which is also an ugly motorcycle. The sun is shining, I sit down on my 2016 GSX S 1000 and drive a lap"
2435,"Visually a failed copy of the Superduke. Otherwise nothing that attracts me to the bike. As always, the test is extensive and informative to look at!"
2436,"15,000 EUR competitive price?  Only in austria due to tax"
2437,"Nothing beats Yamaha for value for money. Who pays 15,000 for a motorcycle?"
2438,Buy a Z900 kawasaki didn't understand Suzuki
2439,"First the optics have to be right, then the insideWerte.Mansees that the Japanese see a lot of comics movies, the motorcycle doesn't appeal to me at all, it looks like shit (to me)"
2440,"I wouldn't want to do without lean angle ABS in this price range, then I'd rather have 25 hp. Leave out unnecessary electronic gimmicks - of course why not. But one of the milestones of security features?"
2441,unfortunately no eye-catcher
2442,ü§¢ü§Æ
2443,"On paper, the Suzuki has more, or am I wrong. And optics are known to be a matter of taste, I think the Suzuki is nicer!"
2444,Wtf how short is the rear.. Soooo dumb...
2445,"The design is angular and edgy, more futuristic. Well done Suzuki!"
2446,"The design is ruthless typical naked muscle,, really cool.."
2447,"Wow... this is just scary, why didn't Suzuki create a scary product in the first place... salute anyway"
2448,a steady leap for the naked version of the suzukiüî•
2449,"The gray color is really great, bro, it looks more detailed with the curves , the savings are starting to thrash out"
2450,üëç Suzuki is classy
2451,"This is the first time I like the Suzuki design on this motorbike. Cool, handsome, cool, kerreeeennnn"
2452,"The design is fierce, the body lines are sharp. So droolrrrr want to ask for her hand."
2453,"if the stop lamp problem is still in the aftermarket, the important thing is that the body design really needs to be changed. Because if you have to modify the body design, that's what I'm lazy about because it's expensive and takes time, I'm satisfied with SUZUKI for the current GSX-S1000"
2454,"If a GSX like this is unmatched, fierce, ferocious, the best Suzuki, Suzuki lover."
2455,"Tired of being ridiculed by the headlamp chicken, finally released a new Suzuki design too, STOP"
2456,Really handsome üòç But the design is similar... - the color is the same as the rear body like the yamaha xabre - the front body and headlamp are similar like a combination of yamaha xride & new mt07 2021
2457,"Indeed, in the motorcycle class, Suzuki's design is frightening"
2458,"This is the first motorcycle from Suzuki, which I admit has a good design, the others, that's how I don't like it, although everyone likes it or not, it's different"""
2459,"even bad Suzuki motorcycles are still maintained, Suzuki lovers."
2460,"I admit that the quality of the Suzuki motorcycle engine is indeed better than others and is resilient because I once had a 2006 Shogun, the pull was good, the flooding was strong, now I use automatic because there are many automatic ones that need maintenance"
2461,this is new SUZUKI hopefully 150cc will also follow üëçüèª
2462,"Poooolllll handsome üòçüòçüòç Try the 150 R gsx, the design looks like the headlights. Maybe you don't think about taking out your savings balance"
2463,"Suzuki is starting to wake up from sleep, the feeling is towards KTM and Moto GP, may it spread to motorbikes in Indonesia"
2464,"CURRENTLY THE BEST BUILD QUALITY IS ONLY SUZUKI & KAWASAKI THAT ALWAYS KEEP THIS FROM THE LAST.. NOT RICH AS HONDA, YAMAHA WHICH IS DECREASING FOR NEKEN COST... GREETINGSüëç"
2465,"If anyone sells this exact custom headlamp, I'll buy it automatically"
2466,"Everyone believes and believes, Suzuki has the best engine quality, materials, paint, etc., it's just that the design is sometimes weird. Lover Suzuki."
2467,"Moge suzuki is really cool. Indeed, Suzuki has to get out of the rounded design path, for future innovations."
2468,I think it's really amazing
2469,I still use the beat for daily
2470,"If you look at the headlamp, it looks like a Yamaha mt"
2471,rear light change
2472,Don't expect Sizuki to give good designs to developing countries... Indonesia must be satisfied with Suzuki bandits who are really like bandits acting invisible or not paying attention
2473,Really handsome! Hopefully it will be the forerunner of the GSX facelift for his brothers and sisters
2474,"not like the usual suzuki. this design is really raging... all out. (y) really monster look. cm I'm not comfortable with the rather ordinary taillights. If you look at it like a Honda CB 150, it might be good, right? the same as the rear turn signal that looks like an upil... :p but it's still cool in the storm... gahar, savage. * talk at length, buy or not. * Satisfied, grateful to have the GSX-S150 only."
2475,Really good!!üëåüëåüëåüëåüëçüëçüëç
2476,It turns out that Yamaha is not wrong in the design of the new MT GENERATION. This is followed by Suzuki
2477,Crazy Suzuki üòç
2478,"¬†I hope that's true, so that the Suzuki market can compete again.. It's a shame that the engine, material and finishing are always top, but only lose in design... Not all consumers, especially Indo can accept this Suzuki manufacturer's design, even though the design character is very strong IMHO.."
2479,It's crazy how crazy the electronics are..üëçüèª
2480,"One of the innovations / frontal movements from the Suzuki design division, which is usually identical to the curved design for smooth air flow (Aerodynamic).... . But Suzuki said that although the design is more angular to make it look fierce, they still do research not to abandon the aerodynamic principle. . . Good Job Suzuki !!! üëç"
2481,Coolüî•
2482,More handsome than the MT series
2483,"The passengers are in a high position, it seems"
2484,"Finally Suzuki threw away his ego, hopefully the fairing version is dual headlamp"
2485,This is a cool model
2486,"if the flagship MT series is designed like this, yamaha fans will also be able to comment out of anger. good job suzuki design team"
2487,"The new gsx r 1000 is also cool, the air scoop looks like keen eyes, plus a small light in the middle... similar to DNA H2"
2488,This is what I like about Suzuki manufacturers... never copy other brand models.
2489,"Smart suzuki takes advantage of the cool moto gp moment, it automatically releases cool market segment motorcycles"
2490,"The front is ok, the back is a little less comfortable"
2491,"I think it's similar to Duke's model, his appearance is sharp and fierce"
2492,Wow that's really cool.üòçüî•üëâüëçüèª
2493,"Suzuki's design is more aggressive, I'm starting to realize this is a manufacturer, was it just a mistake"
2494,Wow really handsome 
2495,"MT 09 sma MT10 2021, yes, it's really similar at first glance, especially when viewed from the front, the headlamp and the tank are boxed like that,,"
2496,Great update
2497,"The design is fierce, fierce according to the engine . I hope there is a 250 Cc version in Indonesia. "
2498,Even more frightening than mt09
2499,Similar to the Yamaha MT 09 headlamp..üòÇ
2500,"The lights are really cool, just like the sfa concept mixed with the vixion advance lamp shell, bro, hehe"
2501,"I actually like the old design more, it's more handsome, but the technology is clear now"
2502,the 2021 version is getting fiercer
2503,Surprised to see how cool the new design looks
2504,Hopefully the design is downgraded to the 150 version
2505,STUNNING SUZUKI üëç
2506,Waooowww so cool üëç
2507,"I'm a kawasaki z800 user.. I think the motorbike is nice to look at.. But after seeing this suzuki gsx... Wow, really nice to see. So want to replace it. Suzuki is the best this time.. drool"
2508,The design is similar to KTM while the headlamp is similar to the Benelli Tornado
2509,"I like the headlamp design the most, it's crazy"
2510,"If version 250 comes out, it will explode in the market"
2511,New design ü§ò
2512,"Wow, I really like Suzuki's design"
2513,"Want to buy, cool"
2514,"It's scary, like a robot, Transformer üëç But it 's expensive, it's not worth it,"
2515,"This is just sadistic, try the GSX-R 1000, it is also more violent and sadistic, it looks like competitors can definitely compete in sales"
2516,"The headlamp is similar to the Honda SFA, but still cool"
2517,This really cool guy. Headlamp
2518,"Suzuki actually could have made designs like this from the start... just look at the gsx s1000 and gsx s1000gt, the designs are much liked even by outsiders who don't like the gsx so they like it because of the release of the new gsx s1000, only the idealist manufacturers maintain the design language, right? how else."
2519,Suzuki recruits creative employees..
2520,Really good!
2521,the design is really scary
2522,"It's a shame the brake lights seem ordinary, if the design imitates the headlights with a multilevel model, it's guaranteed to be cool."
2523,Similar to Yamaha xabreüò≤üò≤
2524,"I personally like the GSX, but there's one thing I don't like about the GSX bike. Only the taillights are weird. Just try it if you change the taillights, they'll be cool. But on one condition, don't take it long join in the demolition"
2525,rhinoceros body
2526,So that's a cool futuristic model
2527,That's just a solid suzuki design
2528,"It's really good, it's tapered, but how come I immediately thought of Xabre, sis. My mind doesn't make sense"
2529,This is the coolest naked version of Suzuki in my opinion
2530,this is awesome bro.
2531,looks like yamaha MT Series
2532,Headlamp like MT üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2533,Turns on the road someone asked how much did the YAMAHA XABRE have been modified .
2534,It's amazing
2535,Nice design
2536,The best naked bike remains the GSX S750
2537,"Headlamp similar to MT07 and MT09 2021, bullet lights like aliens, just different in number and arrangement"
2538,"It's not like a Japanese design, is it European?"
2539,"Suzuki still has no appeal, not even the others"
2540,"If you have money, it's better to buy gsx 1000 from the z1000"
2541,Suzuki is the best.
2542,Wow wow.... Suzuki.
2543,Benelli pantagonia eagle is better...üëçüëçüëç
2544,The engine is still from the 2005 gsx r1000
2545,"In my opinion, the design is just normal, it's still inferior to other manufacturers"
2546,"Want a motorbike that is not marketed but has quality??? Yes, Suzuki is the choice"
2547,Seen from the side very handsome
2548,Monster Suzuki horrified his design
2549,Headlamp models follow in the footsteps of the MT-series
2550,Everyone ; the latest headlamp mt series is really bad Suzuki gsx s 1000; hold my headlamp
2551,The gray one makes you drool
2552,the blue suzuki is really good
2553,The headlights are awesome
2554,Handsome
2555,"It's time to make a stop lamp model, how come Suzuki doesn't seem to have any other innovations, it's a normal stop lamp, like a 2000's motorbike... even though it's all over the body, it's a shame the stop lamp is lacking..."
2556,"the price is insanely cheap for the 1000 cc class, only 190 million, Suzuki is so angry, the price of the motorbike is sadistic, far below the market price for the 1000 cc class."
2557,The headlamp is the same theme as mt 09 2021
2558,. It's really troublesome when the company is led by stubborn old-fashioned people
2559,"This is crazy, it's really cool"
2560,Headlamp similar to mt-09
2561,Better headlamp mt 09 2021
2562,Really unaffordable
2563,Cooler than MT series
2564,"Please suzuki look at the design of the indo market, the important thing is DESIGN"
2565,Does it look like the newest mt series?
2566,"This one‚Äôs a looker, specially the headlight üî•"
2567,Looks superb. Love these lights. All time Suzuki fanboy here
2568,i was a huge fan of the s1000 and s750 previous models....They just looked like beasts üî•
2569,Now this is the design I have been looking forward to. It sure is a head turner
2570,"In my opinion, this headlight looks like a hungry beast ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2571,Suzuki always been an X-factor üî•
2572,"awesome looking bike, I hope they adapt this look in their smaller CC bikes too in India. Also, I came to understand that, Gixxer in India came from GSX R by Suzuki"
2573,It looks amazing! Fuck yeah! Very similar to the custom Suzuki Virus from Suzuki Switzerland ü§§
2574,"How come they ruined the back of the bike, which looks damn good in the front."
2575,Tail should've been sharper Totally agree!
2576,The headlights ohhhhhüòçüòçgives a awesome look to the bike
2577,Suzuki's best part is it's anti-theft paint job.
2578,"I like that design on front but they forgot about the rear, why suzuki why."
2579,The front look is awesome
2580,Looking far better than the last version
2581,The head lights are the main attraction
2582,Suzuki on fire üî•üòç
2583,Heading dope
2584,"For the styling I am on the fence some things are good others not so good and the front and back don't match, front is sharp and back has some smooth lines"
2585,"I prefer this over mt 09 , mt 10 ........on a mere basis of looks !!! This one is a looker"
2586,Dope looking bikeüòé
2587,Fz in steroids üî•
2588,suzuki king of bikes üëëüëë
2589,I like the previous one more
2590,Woah man...thats so big on asthetics and tech
2591,The headlight looks like it is from CONCEPT which is in AUTO SHOW.
2592,The old one looked like a sabre tooth (smilidon) this one looks like a demon from promised Neverland. I'm super disappointed
2593,Looks üî• but wat is tht camouflage treatment (ü§Æ) come on SUZUKI Better to give a carbon fibre treatment or y don't thy stick to body colours....(my opinion).... any way bike looks next level
2594,12.5 lakhs is the best price every penny above that is worthless üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ
2595,Rear looks like 10 yrs old motorcycles rear...why??
2596,The Suzuki GSX S750 has much better looking head lamp design.
2597,When I saw 1000cc This bike is not for me
2598,Reminds me a lot like SHOCKWAVE üòàüòàüòà
2599,"Lights looks robotic, but not much our tastes,"
2600,WOW..
2601,"The bikes headlight looks like, it's from a science fictional movie"
2602,Killer...
2603,Suzuki bikes are always a costly product
2604,KTM feel
2605,Its looks like ktm
2606,Transformers üëç
2607,Bad design
2608,I thinkü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ
2609,No where near to MT 10 though
2610,"A motorcycle that, of its kind, is really well done, like a true Japanese. Then what an engine! Even talking over it, she could clearly hear the sound. Good Suzuki!"
2611,"As owner of the 2015 versino F, tested by you, I can only say that the mechanics are fantastic and the chassis does not betray. This, with the ride by wire, can only be even better, precisely in the aspects that you have emphasized and that in the previous ones required special attention such as, sport filter and correct setting of the TPS. That said, good, as always: clear and concise, go on like this!"
2612,"Beautiful bike !!!! I would take it as a former owner of 4 Suzuki Gsxr, very reliable engines, Suzuki a guarantee !!"
2613,Beautiful bike
2614,I like the previous gsxs much more
2615,as owner I am already very satisfied with the old version ... imagine this ... even if the lighthouse I prefer the old model
2616,"Excellent bike, nothing to do with the bonnet style of the BMW and much more beautiful than the Kawa bravi"
2617,"A katana with quickshift and larger fuel tank, basically this is how I see this new GSX S 1000. the k5 a fantastic engine and the Suzuki chassis the best among the Japanese in this segment, the only drawback if you have the ""old"" GSX S 1000 or even better the katana, you don't want this model to buy it ‚úåÔ∏èüòè"
2618,"I too am a ""differently young"" motorcyclist and, while not appreciating this a little too ""futuristic"" aesthetic, I fully agree with the final concept !!!"
2619,"Rubber tubes, mono with finger-splitting preload, LCD screen of dubious visibility, still the 190/50 ..... Suzuki drowns in a glass of water"
2620,"Nice bike, shame about the vibrations ..."
2621,I prefer the current 750.
2622,"nice bike, nice day and a good lunch in Alba offered by Suzuki ..."
2623,great beautiful bike
2624,Nice but they could put a TFT screen
2625,A mix between ktm super duke 1290 and yamaha 10 mt .... now there is no more style ... always copying from the neighbor .... too bad. Because the mechanics are excellent
2626,Gorgeous
2627,"Suzuki does not economize, it is certainly not Kawasaki with its frames in welded iron tubes ... here there is everything you need and more, quality for an ever lower price ."
2628,Very Katana style!
2629,The rubber hoses have no excuse come on !!! Be objective !!!! At least try it ...
2630,Very nice ... Very ... But on 150 horses ... The braking system is a bit poor
2631,in my experience all suzuki apart from the latest gsxr 1000 owners complain that the brakes could be a bit better
2632,pity ... she was so beautiful..boh ...
2633,"If I could I would buy the CB 1000 R 1000 times. I don't despise this bike, indeed I think it's excellent value for money, but if I put it next to the Honda ... I don't even look at this one anymore. Obviously, everything is a personal opinion. Greetings"
2634,Always bad design after the katana too
2635,"Same gsx s1000 as before, with deteriorated aesthetics and a more complete electronic package. Same LCD dashboard used on the katana since 2019. I hope it does not have the same invasive abs as the one mounted on my ex katana which always entered at every braking on the bumpy lengthening dangerously the braking."
2636,I agree with the criticism on the ABS ... on level 2 a tad invasive.
2637,They're competing to see who makes the ugliest bike lately ...
2638,Terrible...............
2639,Suzuki gets a lot of shit these days for not innovating but this bike is proof positive that their formula of steadily improving what has already been successful is can be a winning strategy. This bike looks appears to be a stunning value. I hope it sells well.
2640,"Not too long ago, I was worried about the whole sport touring segment disappearing, and it is my preferred class of motorcycle. Now, there appears to have been a resurgence and there are several great sport touring bikes available. Well done Suzuki, it's great that they keep refining that awesome GSXR sourced powerplant, it is a legend."
2641,"Sounds like a cracking bike for the price, seat height doesn't sound to bad either. Good review as always üëçüôÇ"
2642,"20% markup compared to the old model. For this, you get a couple of electronics which you don''t need (and I, personally don't give a shit about) and a new fairing. Such innovation. It's now on par with the ninja 1000 sx, and it is slightly cheaper, but it is still not great value for money. Like the original S1000F was. That was a bargain. This is not."
2643,"Im blown away by Suzuki on this one, looks like a cracking bike that is got all you need and more for a good price. Thanks dan!"
2644,That bike is better than I thought it would be. A good tourer and has plenty of power for anyone. Not a bad price either. Those roads looked amazing to ride. Not jealous at all üòÇ
2645,"I'm happy they kept the K5 engine. The newer GSX-R engine will add cost and complexity, but no gains on the road. Suzuki's newest products are absolutely killing it for practicality and value in my opinion."
2646,"Great bike decent price. Handles really well ,confidence inspiring. That was the old bike so the new one must be even better."
2647,"I'm glad they've kept the engine. It's the best in its class. 19-litre fuel tank! Love the stacked lights. Wider bars. I hope the new electronics package is restrained. Quick shifter/blipper = good development. Good dash. Who needs a TFT? The litre inline four I'd buy if I wanted one, especially at that price."
2648,Wow. Suzuki is Evolving and WE LOVE IT. What else could Suzuki when they release the GSX-S 1000F üò±
2649,I've got the previous model and absolutely love it............it looks like i could be upgrading to the 2021 version üôÇüëç Great honest opinion of what you think of the machine Chops......Good job.üôÇüëç
2650,"Nice to see that Suzuki thought of the poor bikers like me to keep it reasonable and not to fall into to trap of too many gizmos, too much power and putting it out of reach for many. They have kept a powerful up-dated bike affordable. That's the litre bike I was waiting for ! Well done Suzuki ! Let's hope it's a good ride as well and I might be on my way to a Suzuki dealer."
2651,"Your 2015 is the same as the 2021, actually it‚Äôs just like the 2005 also."
2652,just the k5 engine in a different tune. World's apart with new technology and suspension.
2653,"I understand exactly what it is.. Suzuki is not worlds apart from what was produced almost two decades ago. It‚Äôs a great bike for the money. Powerful, dependable, just wish Suzuki would step it up, like Yamaha has done the FZ/MT line."
2654,"it‚Äôs a lot of bike for the money, I‚Äôll leave it at that. It‚Äôs the bargain bike in the class for a reason."
2655,"Looks good. Hopefully the 750 will follow suit - a 100cc increase on that bike would make it vastly more competitive in the segment, but I wouldn‚Äôt get my hopes up for anything other than the updated styling and the new dash"
2656,looks like a great bike with a lot of potential
2657,"never been a fan of the GSXS, but this one looks nice, different, i hope it gets better components than the last ones"
2658,"I quite like the looks of the front end - almost like the love child of a Katana and the new MT-09. Cracking value too considering the spec! And for the love of God, can we have a whip round to get Chops a decent roll of gaffer tape! :D"
2659,"It's awesome they increased the tank size, they may have learned their mistake with the Katana lol. For the money compared to the other bikes this seems like a winner IMO"
2660,Ride by wire throttle will iron out the snatchyness - a bug bear of the previous bike - for the price this is a winner IMO and personally I like the styling ‚ö°Ô∏è
2661,I must say the GSX-S excites me about as much as a Bosch fridge/freezer combo though.. IMO the Speed Triple is heads and shoulders above. Even the <2021 model. That's of course just like my opinion :) Cheers!
2662,I think it looks great. The front really made a step forward. The ugly duckling new MT09 could learn from that. Overall amazing value for money IMO..
2663,"Wow, Suzuki did what Yamaha has been trying to do, a very attractive futuristic design.."
2664,"I actually like the dash, with the overall looks, it reminds me of some 80's sci fi vehicle"
2665,"Looks like a Grom had a juicy sleepover with a Superduke. I have to admit, I do like it!"
2666,"¬£11k is a great price, I think the bike will be a lot of fun and 150bhp is bang on the money for exciting yet manageable power for a naked."
2667,"Think she looks great, love the improved styling but there's some bargains now on the outgoing model, very tempted. Cheers Chopsy"
2668,No doubt it's a good bike but that bloody headlight üò£
2669,"I dont have an issue with the k5 motor. Its one of my favorite I4 motors of the 2000s. Im thinking full exhaust, tune and air filter will put this girl into 160ish hp.. thats plenty of power for me. I might have to buy one.. never liked the old models design but this one is a lot better"
2670,"I just love Suzuki for being conservative and classical, especialy with this bike! Just loving it. So i hope they keep in production for 5-6 years! =)"
2671,This is without doubt the bike that want in my garage be it an older one or the new one I luv it can't wait ta see ya out on one soon cheers : )
2672,"I love this new headlight, man. It‚Äôs like transformers!"
2673,I think it's much better than previous model.
2674,it‚Äôs the first autobot but I‚Äôm not a fan as much anymore. Still a dope bike.
2675,More looks like a Jegan from MS Gundam series.
2676,"Would even look at the previous model due to it's styling,this rocks...finally in the 21st Century"
2677,There's no question the previous model was looking dated. On that I agree. I don't understand then trend towards super sharp edges though. Imagine if a car had this sort of styling. It would look ridiculous and only the most juvenile of boys would want one. Yet for some reason in bikes people eat that shit up.
2678,That headlight lookd like a EVA from evangelion..
2679,"Cool design, reliable engine, now with electronics, robot like headlight and great value. Love that Dash, cool that Suzuki has a different dash, all brands with TFT and Suzuki doing it their way .,..kudos Suzuki."
2680,Great bike for sure!
2681,"To me, the styling looks very much like they've copied the KTM Super Duke shape. Looks good, not fussed on the headlight, sounds like a cracking naked bike and really good price tag! Chops, perhaps use duck tape next time? LOL. Great video, as always. Ride safe and have fun,"
2682,"I agree, it looks like a KTM and that's a shame"
2683,"Love my 18. Spend $1000 on a shock upgrade and ECU flash and you're golden. Amazing engine, extremely underrated bike."
2684,This thing is really gorgeous. Reminds me of SDR1290
2685,the slightly underrated but rather uninspired GSX-S1000.
2686,Sounds like it could still be a great road bike for the money.
2687,Now if it was pumping out 180hp well now that's an update.
2688,I always thought for the money the bike was a value purchase and now it appears to be better
2689,Yes sir I think the same way. The bike looks very Litüî•just sad that Suzuki don't but the gixxer 1000 engine would be gr8tüíØ
2690,"Let‚Äôs just say it won‚Äôt have a IMU for that kind of money, as we‚Äôve experienced with other bikes in the past. This bike was always on my list as a new bike and I must admit I‚Äôve been waiting for an update but I‚Äôm a little disappointed. I don‚Äôt like the front but maybe it will grow on me, let‚Äôs just hope it still sounds amazing üòéüëç Still waiting on the new Triumph though üòâ"
2691,"They never do enough they always seem to leave something off the table, but still a great bike and great value."
2692,"Sounds good mate, in real world road riding, wouldn't need more than 150hp anyway, great that they threw in the quick shifter and modes awesome"
2693,That price will go a long way to make me ignore some of my critisims of it. Plus it looks a million times better than the old one. Suzuki just make makes mechanicaly gorgeous bikes.
2694,"For the price, I think suzuki has done a great job."
2695,"Suzuki sticking with their usual way of doing things - V Strom, Hayabusa and now the GSXS......It‚Äôs probably still a great bike but what happened to innovation - they used to be right up there leading the pack."
2696,"Yes, you're absolutely right. 4 kg heavier than the previous. 2 hp more, but at 1000 rpm more (152 hp @ 11.000 rpm ) ! Torque down -3 Nm than previous ! Disappointed big time. Why not the rims from R1000 (guess saving 3 kg in all) . So now you pay roughly 1600 ‚Ç¨ (in mainland Europe) for extra 4 kg of full LED, ride by wire, new plastic + gastank (design) and a QS ! What's missing here : A derated VVT engine with 150 hp and the original 119 Nm of torque. Cruise control. 6-chanel EMU and the weight of the GSX-R1000 and the final one : Electronic suspension. Sorry Suzuki. This is old wine in a cracked bottle."
2697,"So true, Suzuki = boring, sadly :("
2698,"Hope it does well for Suzuki, but not sure it‚Äôs changed enough to tempt buyers"
2699,The shadow image at the end of your video definitely resembles a super duke 1290R. The K5 engine is all she needs :) An Imu would be nice though for advanced lean angle traction / braking etc.
2700,"It's a handsome enough bike although not exactly in front of the curve design-wise. Personally I am not keen on the dash at all. So what we learned is that Suzuki keeps doing what they have been doing for decades, they skip a couple of generations of innovation (when was the last time Suzuki innovated?) and so they are able to keep the price down. But should we really call it a bargain, when you can get a Kawasaki Ninja 1000SX for practically the same price (11.299)?"
2701,I've been unable to make up my mind what I'll get for years. At first I wanted the old CB1000R but couldn't get one then I thought I might just get the suzuki because it may actually be a slightly better bike even though they could have made it look better. The snatchy throttle wouldn't have bothered me because I kind of like taming a light switch where it's either on or off. The main thing that concerned me was tall gearing as I do most of my riding inner city commute. I had an 08 street triple 675 which was perfect for my ride but it got stolen twice in a row so I gave up. Now I'm really in love with the look of the new honda cb1000r especially since it was revised and is now all black. Problem with that is I think it probably lacks a little on the power compared to competition and I found it was a little high and the square seat kinda hurt the inside of my legs just testing it inside the shop. I also see myself caring too much about it and looks like a nightmare to keep clean. Now they have finally revised the suzuki but I sort of dislike the new headlight even though I liked the headlight on the new MT09. I think if the suzuki has revised the gearing it'll be a no brainer but the MT09 and the CB1000R are still on my radar. If I want to get stupid with my money I'll probably just look at the new speed triple.
2702,"Spec sounds great for the price, look forward to getting down a dealer in the future and getting ride."
2703,"Great review and great bike, and it's even better value in Australia, only ¬£9130/AUS$17290 ride away with a 3 year warranty üòÄ"
2704,"almost got one of the older models , this one looks good"
2705,"Overall bike seems great, love the new dash. The front end is fugly though and I couldn't buy a bike that I find a part of that offensive! :)"
2706,"looks a bit like the old Duke, i love it!"
2707,Throttle seems to be fixed now
2708,"I've got the previous gen which I love the looks of. This one, not so I'm afraid"
2709,Lovely bike
2710,"I own GSX-S750 L8 which is one of the sharpest looking bikes from Suzuki when you equip it with tail tidy, bar-end mirrors, and Yoshi end can. I am not sure about the new looks of this bike... It does remind me of the new 1290 Super Duke R from the side profile which I do like, but this headlight is just horrible and does not fit with the rest of that aggressive look. Did they use the staircase for inspiration when they were designing the headlight? Haha! It looks like the new MT09 which is (in my opinion) one of the ugliest bikes ever designed! Anyhow, I think they should have taken the DNA from the new GSX-R1000 and build up the new GSX-S from there. Reusing the same sharp tail, that sleek headlight with a thin led-stripe on each side, same suspension, and of course engine. I rather spend my money on the new S1000R for a couple of thousand more! On the positive side, it does get QS now, which was about the damn time :P"
2711,meh on the bike but seems quality for the price I suppose. I still think all new bikes should long have a TFT display considering technologically nothing prevents them from having them and they open up so many more options
2712,"I've been looking at the CB1000R but I always liked the GSXS 750, it just didn't look that good. This one looks amazing, I reckon it trounces the Honda. proper evolution and less of the rubbish curvy crap. Love it"
2713,Looks like a lot of bike for the money
2714,"I really like this bike. I know Suzuki takes a lot of flack for not innovating or putting out brand new bikes, but they seem to be making the right evolutions on their flagship bikes (talking vstrom 1050). If they can do the same to the vstrom/SV 650 lines..."
2715,"Some good improvements, but Suzuki's lack of innovation over the last decade and a half is why I shifted to KTM. Of course I also prefer twins, so they probably would have had to produce a TL1300S or SV1300S to keep me with the brand."
2716,I can see myself being interested in one of these on the used market
2717,It'd have to see it in the metal but I prefer the look of the previous model. Get one second hand and add a rear shock and you'd have a great bargain naked just like the Bandits of old.
2718,It looks good! 
2719,"Im not a fan of naked bikes, but this one looks very good, and with quickshifter up and down I like it even more!"
2720,". Smiles per $$$ I think this is a winner. Now in the looks department I think the front could use some work, but the shot of it dead straight on looked quite good"
2721,"Not fussed on the stacked headlight. Saying that, the 999 broke the mould with that and it took time but it's accepted now."
2722,"The rear shock was, well....shocking. Compression was way too hard."
2723,Brilliant well done Suzuki
2724,not completely sold on the look of the front but mabey it's a grower
2725,Might have to rethink my triumph street triple rs order . üôà that‚Äôs a whole lotta bike for 11K . Can‚Äôt wait till you get your grubby little mits on it to hear your thoughts .
2726,The Suzuki blue colour scheme is one of the best looking on any bike
2727,"That bike felt like the best kept secret. People hated the look of the hawk nose front end, but they didn't know that it gave the bike more front end stability and downforce in turns over the naked S model. Plus the added bonus of wind protection."
2728,Suzuki: NEW FOR 2021 with the following updates : NO LONGER BROKEN!
2729,"Pretty sure Im going to go for a Tuono. And that's coming from a current GSXS 1000 owner. Great bike, just not THAT exciting. Looks alone wont make me update mine to the new one."
2730,They only revamped the GSXS so it will pass Euro-5 emissions... Which means they had to make it ride by wire.
2731,"As an 2019 ex-katana owner ...i wracked it üòÅüòÅüòÅ...i am sure it is excellent even without IMU...Because it is suzuki...unfortunately this new design is not worth to trade my ducati panigale 959 yet...I am sure there will be a Katana version of it...I will be waiting for this possible KATANA version, with much fairing and more all weather protection..."
2732,"Props to suzuki for using that forged carbon pattern, it looks proper rather than using mainstream carbon weave."
2733,1100 pounds. How much will Suzuki charge in US$. MT10 and Ducati Supersport is $12999 US. Was hoping for more with this update. I'd like to have seen 180ish hp. Headlight is ok. Looks like an MT10 turned sideways. Joining the transformer crowd.
2734,Nice bike and good value really üëçüèª
2735,I see early-KTM duke styling and and bunch of tech waiting to be retrofitted to a 2005 gsxr ;0) Thanks Suzuki
2736,Front side wings look like the 2017+ superduke and front light is similar but evolved version of the 2015 superduke
2737,It would have been a really nice bike 5 years ago
2738,I‚Äôm a Suzuki fam but Yamaha beat you to the punch.
2739,1/4 front view with light away... it looks like a Lego bike. I must have one.
2740,Is Suzuki even capable of making a good looking bike?
2741,Best thing I did to mine was changing the front sprocket.
2742,Luv it! Not sure I‚Äôm digging that headlight set up on new model
2743,Classic suzuki always far behind the other brands in term of updating and improving their bikes the same old things over and over. They changed the look and now it look kinda like the katana
2744,That's cool Suzuki gave you the low down early . It'll benefit from a fly screen me thinks...
2745,"just the 2005 engine, only the best GSXR engine ever made"
2746,I'll stick with my B-King!
2747,I still love my bking better lol 
2748,The headlight and surrounds look very katana-ish.
2749,"Truly with this one, Suzuki have shown us once again that they have mastered the art of making ugly motorcycles."
2750,"The Japanese nakeds like the MT-07, 09 and this are looking very transformer-like."
2751,Looks this bike is good value for the money but the proof will be in the riding. Not fussy on the headlight arrangement.
2752,The front of the bike reminds me of a 2016 Honda grom but this one went to the gym.
2753,Looks aggressive üëç
2754,"Great that you can still buy 4 cylinder bikes. Twins and tripples seem to be getting all the press, but ........."
2755,"In my opinion poeple don't appreciate the K5 engine enough, yes it is 16 years old but it's been heavily revised, it's still a great engine in today's standard, the power delivery is silky smooth and a lot of low end torque (I've got the current model Katana), the intake howl just sound sexy. So whoever complained about the K5, I think you really should go and test ride one, it's better than the cb1000r (with the 2007 fireblade engine), and 150hp is not shy."
2756,The CB1000r and the KLR650 and maybe one other. Those are the only bikes I think have actually improved in the looks department. The rest are getting hideous. Could be worse. Could be boring looking like the BMW s1000r.
2757,I like everything about it except the looks. It's closer to a Yamaha or KTM and that is not a compliment.
2758,"I have a 2018 and this is half a step forward. Rider modes but no cruise control, rear shock only has preload and rebound the same as the previous model. Unfortunately Suzuki missed the mark yet again and will ride this design for another 6 years. Still great value for money but at the cost of falling far behind the euro competition."
2759,"Wonder why they don't release the full potential of the K5 engine, that would be awesome."
2760,Looks like the old GSR that went to bed with the MT09
2761,19L tank omg thats so good
2762,"Slightly larger fuel tank, 3 power modes, 2 extra TC levels, Quickshifter and autoblipper stock!. Meanwhile the Katana that came out last year is now an overpriced downgrade unless they update it too."
2763,something tells me previous models are a good investment for those who dont want that electronics crap going on
2764,Definitely looks better then the 2021 MT09. Any word if it has electronic cruise control? There is no reason for any throttle by wire bike not to already come with cruise in 2021.
2765,I love it. I want it.
2766,could be a winner for suzuki that. Nice machine
2767,"SUZUKI - Here is our new GSX-S1000 ME - WOW does it have a new engine ? SUZUKI - no it's the same engine we made in 2005 ME- umm ok, does it have a new frame? SUZUKI - well no, it's a frame we made in 2014. ME - okay okay, but you put a color TFT on it didn't you? SUZUKI - ahh no, we put a LCD on it, you know like yamaha did to their MT-10 in 2016. ME - come on guys, well at least you put a IMU didn't you? Cause like everyone does that even in little bikes. SUZUKI - No we didn't put an IMU in it ether. ME - what did you guys actually do then, other then new plastic bodywork!! SUZUKI - Look just be happy with what we gave you, it could be worse. We could have given it less HP like we did to the HAYABUSA. ME - what happened to you SUZUKI? You use to be somebody, now you are ...are..this! ALSO ME - can't wait to see the new YAMAHA MT-10 when they release it, Bye Suzuki it was nice knowing you."
2768,Suzuki never fails to disappoint.
2769,Reminds me of my first girlfriend ugly as sin but no doubt a decent ride üôà
2770,Front end does look unfinished. Ruins the whole bike IMO.
2771,when we thought the new mt09 and mt07 were bad in terms of looks...
2772,"Really, really dumb. Someone at Suzuki doesn't want their bikes to be a success. No cruise control in 2021? No IMU (not in press release = doesn't have) Terrible dash ($&@/#! Speedo is tiny!!) The bike looks way better but......."
2773,This bike needs a new engine. In an age of 200hp super-nakeds Suzuki is way behind in the game. They might as well sell this bike as a competitor for a MT 09 instead.
2774,I think it's gorgeous
2775,"This will be one to pick up at years end for a bargain not at retail value. It's just a disappointing release. I sold my gsx s and am not buying another. No imu,cruise control, still heavy bike , not a great looking headlight."
2776,EPIC BIKE
2777,Suzuki competing with MT series for the ugliest headlights.üòÇ
2778,Suzuki: Welcome to the NEW NOT ALL NEW BUT UPDATED GSXS1000
2779,Nice bike for the money üí∑
2780,"Was waiting for this for months so disappointed no VVT or IMU, the side profile looks awkward, the front I don‚Äôt mind but can see those headlights getting destroyed with stones. Oh well maybe in another 5 years we will get the VVT engine"
2781,Wish they would have put cruise control on this bike
2782,looks sharp. I like it and hopefully pcp will be pocket money.
2783,The black one looks best
2784,best motorcycle for working class man ! Really cool is like the old GSR
2785,They've had to weld the cat on üòî
2786,So basically it's the same power with some updated plastic and electronics.
2787,It's good that it's cheap.
2788,Cool ü§ò
2789,Just been to look at one of these and what a disappointment!! Cheap plastics cheap stickers cheap led screen and the whole thing looks cheap. I think suzuki have lost their way!
2790,Katana killer ;)
2791,"They fixed the bikes number one problem, it‚Äôs looks. It‚Äôs now totally on my radar, I would have had one if the old one didn‚Äôt remind me of a half eaten whale I saw that washed up one time, it was gross, and so was the whale"
2792,I'm a sucker for forged carbon.
2793,"Typical Suzuki, no innovation what so ever. At least Triumph, Ducati, Aprillia and Yamaha are trying to make significant changes to their bikes."
2794,New Suzuki = 2005 Suzuki
2795,"It's a shame but Suzuki have lost their mojo over the past few years. Rehashing old models (SV650, Hayabusa.....) & producing the ""beige"" of the current superbikes in the GSXR1000. Dealerships seem to be dwindling & I can see them pulling out of the bike market in Europe. Such a shame for the company that brought us the RG500, RGV250, SRAD750, TL1000S, Bandits & K5GSXR1000. Not sure what they stand for now. They are like Yamaha before they hit gold with their MT series."
2796,So Suzuki is following Yamaha with the ugly headlights I see.....
2797,whos gonna tell them that tail is WORSE than the infamous Gladius cow tail??? impossible!!
2798,Don‚Äôt like it without the belly pan
2799,"Looks OK, but it‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt or won‚Äôt compete with the new breed of nakeds"
2800,"this, the mt07 and the mt09 are very very ugly, I like suzuki and Yamaha but this is the truth"
2801,"Wait, what makes TFTs old hat? What're they making that will replace them? Its a bit ridiculous that you can get a TFT on a Duke 390 and not a GSXS1000. Even the most basic motorcycles have TFTs. They just changed some fairings, retuned the bike and changed the headlamp. How does Suzuki expect to compete with the likes of KTM or Triumph?"
2802,"The LCD is MUCH better. TFTs are invisible in sunlight, and switching menus and menus to find info is stupid. Had a GSXS750 and the LCD was awesome. Old-school looking but practical."
2803,I hate this new look they're giving motorcycles. New bikes don't look beautiful at all anymore. They look like robots now. Super lame.
2804,"No IMU, no updates to the shit gearing (too long first, too short 6th), no thanks"
2805,That headlight is absolutely horrendous.
2806,so far I'm v disappointed
2807,Ewww. Ride-by-Wire üëé. Front headlight looks better now.
2808,God that is hideous ü§Æü§Æü§Æ!! WTF were they thinking about ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò≥!
2809,Nobody in this market wants a gsxr engine. Add $5k for the bike you were hoping for.
2810,Nah. Not feeling it.
2811,"Wake the fuck up Suzuki! - this isn‚Äôt good enough, not by a mile"
2812,"Its ugly. It did need updating, but damn"
2813,"Suzuki needs to replace Stevie Wonder from doing their designs , terrible attempt at trying to close the gap to Yamahas MT naked bikes."
2814,the front looks like a cartoon snail.
2815,wow they sure made the front horrible looking
2816,Not a very attractive bike.
2817,sorry i don't like it the previous model looks better head lights look shit but that's just my opinion
2818,Uuuuuuugly!!!!
2819,Shite... Just get a used s1000r instead.
2820,"So typical lame suzuki, beating a dead horse for 15 years before a thorough rework. That front headlight is utterly atrocious to."
2821,That‚Äôs 1 ugly motorcycle!!!!!!!!
2822,"Love Suzuki, hope more of the bikes get a much needed refresh."
2823,I just want the 750 version with a F designation and a subframe that can handle some saddlebags. Would be such a good small sport tourer/commuter/1-bike owner do everything bike.
2824,Definitely looks better then the 2021 MT09. Any word if it has electronic cruise control? There is no reason for any throttle by wire bike not to already come with cruise in 2021.
2825,"I have the 2016 and its the best bike I've every owned. I can see a ecu flash, full exhaust to get rid of 15lbs of weight and restriction, and maybe a light weight lithium battery would really wake this bike up and make it a little more competitive with less weight and more power. To bad they went up in weight....my 2016 is 456lbs wet. But I did all the mods plus some listed above and she is a beast....never dyno'd her but I can feel the gains I got by a lot."
2826,I just took one look at this bike and thought WOW Suzuki does it again!
2827,"Considering this is euro 5 compliment and makes a bit more power means tuning potential with tune, full exhaust and other boltons is very promising."
2828,"Motorcycle companies be like: ""It is styled to look like a jet-fighter."" Meanwhile guys over at Lockheed Martin: ""Our new fighter jet is designed to look like a sports motorcycle."" Comon. I want my motorcycles to look like a motorcycle. Whether the lack of IMU actually makes a lick of difference for the average person doing the average sporty thing, remains to be seen. These days it's like guys bragging about the hardware in their iPhone, which from an experience perspective means next to nothing. If the ABS and TC works really well, a lack of IMU isn't a downer necessarily. It wasn't that long ago and bikes didn't have ABS, or had very rudimentary ABS that was trash."
2829,I love the color and outline. It makes me feel like it's manly but yet still allow us to feel like a kid again lol.
2830,Very excited for this unless Yamaha updates the mt10. Good upgrade from my z1000.
2831,I have the gsxs1000 F 2018. After seeing many videos of this new version...I'm not quite sure it's enough for me to upgrade.
2832,Interesting. I like the Ducati competitor more. In this segment.
2833,Looks sharp. Now if Yamaha would just go ahead and announce the Mt-10 for updated comparisons.
2834,That headlight will be a pain to clean.
2835,This update Suzuki made puts the S1000 close/equal to the current MT-10. The S1000 is still a little down on power and still a few pounds heavier
2836,"Still has a long way to go to be competitive. For the money its still a good bike. MT10 is overpriced for what it is. Still saying that Aprilia has the perfect balance of everything....price, electronics, power, and weight."
2837,"After he said it weighs in at 472lbs., I instantly went back to my MT-09 search. Come on Suzuki, this ain‚Äôt 1990. Lighten up!"
2838,"people who complain about the lack of an IMU won't be complaining when they see the MSRP. my dinky little tuono 660 was 11.1k (with options), so 11.3k for a liter bike like this is absolutely freaking incredible."
2839,Such a fan of that K5 engine.
2840,I want it. It's perfect for me.
2841,K5 type engine has never had trouble keeping up with anything. In fact 2005 gsxr 1000 give new Ducati a good run for the money.
2842,"they‚Äôre so close actually you‚Äôll never notice the difference in speed between them until you‚Äôre over 140mph. Especially with the gearing difference, everywhere you‚Äôll use it except huge race tracks like road America the difference in acceleration won‚Äôt be big at all. Shit I take wayyyyy faster bikes with my z1000 all the time. R1s, rsv4s, 2 super dukes in one run. It‚Äôs not the arrow it‚Äôs the Indian firing it. I bet you‚Äôll feel a lot more comfortable getting good with the broad and forgiving power curve of the 1000cc 4 banger and gsxr1000 swing arm over the high strung Ducati with its big lopsided lever of a swing arm"
2843,Kind of looks like a blue KTM Super Duke
2844,So even with the updated rider aids it's still basicly the same engine since 2006... Come on Zuki! A question for people who like google history. What year did Suzuki last come with a New bike to their segment? BTW I've been a fan of Suzuki since the Slabside came back in1985.
2845,This bike previous gen was fun to ride.
2846,"Just call it a ""Gixxus 1000"". The K5 motors are great, but are dinosaurs. If they are going to keep usinh an old platform, they need to start innovating and making the bikes competitive towards the other brands. I've always loved Suzuki and have owned 4 of them, but after I started demoing and researching other bikes, They really are years behind most of the other brands, especially at their price points. If this bike is 10-12k there is absolutely zero reason to buy it. that price point is flooded with exciting bikes that make this bike seem like its being ridden by fred flintstone and has square wheels. I bought a Gixxus 750 the first year it came out and it was the best bike that I've ever owned.14,000 miles and there was never one thing wrong with it, Have the valves checked at 12k(I think) and not one was out of speck. The bike even shook off a 55 mph deer strike. I only sold because I bought a KTM 1290 Super adventure R and I was tired of the inline 4(This was my first one. I'm Used to Twins). But it was such a plain jane bike. I had a tripometer, thats it. However, neither this one nor the 1000 has ever sold well. Ive never seen one at a dealer that wasnt under discount. In standard Suzuki tradition, they made another bike that just....good enough, but not great. For the price point of the Gixxus 1000, there is way too much competition with more horsepower and better tech and a more exciting ride."
2847,Very nice bike I like the color
2848,That headlight is way too small. People in cars are going to pull out in front of you. Mark my words.
2849,the original engine was super durable and with this being a tuned down version it should be extremely reliable.
2850,More the electronics ....more the headache ....
2851,"If only it didnt have all the rider aids. This is exactly the bike im looking for but im not interested in all the gimics. Motorcycle sales are in a slump and i would love to buy new to help out but no one makes a bike im interested in now. Its not that the current bikes are terrible, its just i dont care for abs, rider modes or traction control. Even 10 years ago i had plenty of choices without all that but now i have almost zero choices. Perhaps manufacturers should go back a little in time and make proper bikes. Not every one wants a tft screen even if you think they do. Analog tach for me or no sale."
2852,"I like this bike, but the dashes they put on bikes today are just unnecessary. Also riding modes are just not needed. Really needs an analog speedometer."
2853,suzuki had the chance to make it a super naked to fight with superduke r and tuono but they failed. its just a naked and thats a shame!
2854,why do folks like the boring grey model... this is a motorcycle for crying out loud.. save the boring color for your car get a bright color for your bike. its supposed to have flash
2855,"Every manufacturer brought the weight down. BMW S1000R, KTM 1290R, TRIUMPH 1200RS, NEW MT-09. And SUZUKI goes up 11 lbs, from 461 to 472 lbs. Even KTM 1290 R is lighter. Total disappointment for sure, because they definitely did not even try to at least keep the same weight. Suzuki is dying slowly."
2856,Too much plastic. Looks cheap.. I am sure it is not!!
2857,"I'd kind of like one of these, although I've decided to go down in cc. If I did, though, it would be the base model. This TFT is hideous, and who needs rider modes. The incredibly expensive exhausts visually improve the model in this video."
2858,I would 100% buy one if it didn't require refuelling every 45 minutes. Test ride was very impressive.
2859,"But seriously, this is a 1200cc making 120bhp? Seems underpowered."
2860,"120hp doesn‚Äôt sound much, but it‚Äôs where the power comes on that counts üòâ it‚Äôs no slouch."
2861,For a tall bloke would you buy this or a z900rs for a 1hour commute. I would probably go with the Z900RS
2862,Obviously not financially viable.
2863,I want to try an FTR 1200.
2864,badass awesome
2865,I want one!
2866,I was sitting on this bike on EICMA and the bike looks really good and with many tank color grafics it was amazing. For me one of the better looking bike of 2019.
2867,"I ordered the FTR a few weeks ago and of course test drove it first. I can share the enthusiasm for the moped, but also the criticism of the side stand and the small tank. As far as the tank is concerned, I would like to correct you briefly: It's not that small because it's so flat: The air intake tract is under the ""tank"" cover, the petrol tank is under the seat. This contributes to the fact that the FTR is so easy to handle despite the high weight. By the way, you had the display in night mode the whole time, in day mode it is easier to read in daylight. It cannot be operated exclusively via the touchscreen, but alternatively either via the buttons directly on the display or while riding via the control buttons on the handlebars. bluetooth connectivity, the driving modes and features such as cruise control are gimmicks, but the overall package on a high-quality basis is quite appropriate for the price - compared to motorcycles in the same class. The driving assistants (ABS and traction control) are curve-sensitive. By the way, the seat height is 840cm and cannot be adjusted differently. Alternatively, there is a flat tracker seat in the accessories catalogue. This probably gets you to the 805 cm seat height you've heard of. Alternatively, there is a flat tracker seat in the accessories catalogue. This probably gets you to the 805 cm seat height you've heard of. Alternatively, there is a flat tracker seat in the accessories catalogue. This probably gets you to the 805 cm seat height you've heard of. Speaking of the price: the list price shouldn't deter you from going to the Indian dealer and talking to him üòâ. And if the ""S"" version you tested is too expensive for you, you can take a look at the slightly cheaper basic version. Of course, tastes differ and the FTR stands out from the crowd. That's a feature that matters to me personally, but not to others. So it's okay that the opinions are so different. The FTR polarizes. Sure ... it's also from Polaris, hehe üòä. "
2868,"The Indian brilliantly passed the braking test with a dry ""yes"" and the emotions in the acceleration test from 0-100 km/h are unique"
2869,"The bike looks very nice, but this tank is a joke - by the time the box has warmed up properly, half the tank is empty again üôà with a ""sensible"" driving style, the 1200 will probably never consume 6 liters per 100km. Simply building the tank 5 cm higher would not have changed the look, but it would be 20 liters tank capacity, I just don't understand the manufacturer"
2870,"I was able to test drive it at the end of September and I was very conflicted. The optics and the sound are great, but the license plate holder is impossible, the engine is cultivated and runs like a pig, but the gas is delayed and jerky. What irritated me a lot is the running noise of the tires, it sounds like an agricultural machine üòÇ For ‚Ç¨15,000 I simply lack the finishing touches here."
2871,Optically absolutely great! Reminds me of the Svartpilen 701.
2872,"the motorcycle is chic but too special for me. In my opinion, the speedometer looks kinda cheap. There is also an analog version, which I personally found more stylish."
2873,Great outstanding bike
2874,I really like the design.
2875,"Great test, great machine. üëçüëç Something different. I did a lap today...wonderful. Can't you test an Endfield? Have a nice weekend."
2876,"The FTR V2 engine/sound with 123 hp and plenty of torque, just the right amount of performance for everyday use and fun, as well as the fully adjustable chassis and the good brakes. What I don't like is the rough price (a Z900 with comparable performance costs 9000‚Ç¨, not 15-17000 and runs 240kmh, not only 193), the round headlight and license plate holder on the swingarm (I'm not a fan of it), the relatively high weight, the exhaust, the manifold heating on the right side is definitely not fun in summer, the side stand footrest problem mentioned, consumption (6 L) could be significantly lower, zero wind protection, tank with significantly more volume and the width and profile of the bicycle tires that are on it (only 150s). As a mixture of naked, cruiser, and scrambler, the FTR is probably not bad if you are willing to pay so much money for a lifestyle product that is not quite mature. Maybe when I get closer to retirement age and don't want to end up on a chopper.üòâ"
2877,"Super bike, bought it in August 2019, confirm all the poss and negs mentioned in the test. In addition, the original cartography is not top. Otherwise a real eye-catcher in terms of design and great to drive. There aren't many bikes that I've enjoyed that much, so the price, which is very high, doesn't bother me because you can't see an FTR1200 in every pass."
2878,The prettiest bike of the year and one of the prettiest new bikes ever in my opinion (despite the license plate bracket).
2879,"6l/100km probably only if you drive sparingly... certainly 150km if you ""exit"" the country road"
2880,Way too expensive!
2881,"Just being beautiful is not enough. Why is the machine running at only 193? There is no passenger, the license plate holder doesn't work at all and the tank is enough to the nearest ice cream parlour. The passage no longer rips it out. All not my case BUT: Someone will definitely like it. In that sense, have a good trip to all of you."
2882,"Why is it always the unprofessional stumbling in at the beginning? You usually cut everything, so you can just start like others. Oh, you don't want that - the channel where the moderators stumble into the picture, that's a unique selling point. As always, the test was extremely precise. A great bike, but overall a bit overpriced."
2883,UGLY THING AND GOOD FOR NOTHING!!!!!
2884,Nice bike and awful product placement
2885,Dream bike ‚ù§Ô∏è
2886,At this price point the performance of this bike is laughable. You way better off with a Ducati Diavel.
2887,At this price point i would definitely suggest MV Agusta Brutale 800
2888,Nice bike but over priced
2889,Wtf a single rear and front discs and no quick shifter for a 1 litre plus bike
2890,I would prefer speed twin over this.
2891,It would be perfect if not for that ungly rear plate fender thing.
2892,It is looks like husquarna bikes
2893,This is awesome but i would save up more and go for ducati diavel for 22 lakhs
2894,rather buy a 10r...but i love the indian though
2895,"This bike is just on the list of legends, followed by Ducati ktm and Harley"
2896,"he explains about the skidding of tyres due to over power which the tyres couldn't handle during corners and loosing grip,be safe while u drive in ghat section"
2897,Its a hoon
2898,I just remembered Vitpilen 701
2899,n average indian cant afford this indian
2900,"If I noticed it correctly, the rear wobbles a hell lot than what can be called safe. Not exactly a wobble, just power cut in n out by the traction to actually keep you safe!"
2901,Loved the look
2902,Rs. 16 lakh :(
2903,The design is my favrit
2904,Its looks better than ducatti
2905,It's definitely among the better-looking motorcycles!
2906,Very Stylish Visual of BIKE speechless
2907,Both a beauty and a beast
2908,I would prefer the Legendary Honda African Twin instead of this.
2909,Indian? I am out! üëã
2910,Looks more like Ducati Scramblerüò¥
2911,That bike seems like a monster. 
2912,I never expected it to perform the way it does with so much weight. The bike is pure madness just soo much fun put into it. A bigger fuel tank could have been a huge factor for this bike though.
2913,I don't want to buy this moto.
2914,annoyed with the only on-off TC option.
2915,"What a beauty. Gave me the chills. Just something you need before you head out for your weekend ride with the gang. Smart pluggins, get you gotta make money"
2916,"Tail light, fuel tank and other body parts are copied from Husqvarna Vitpilen 701 & Ducati scrambler."
2917,This machine is a serious loon let loose
2918,Price is higher than a tank capacity üòÇüòÇ
2919,whaoooo this bike is totaly lit AF
2920,
2921,"I own an FTR 1200S RR, and I can only confirm everything Andrea said, certainly negligible defects, engine strengths with torque avalanches !!!"
2922,"consumption depends a lot on the driving style and the type of road you are on. I on average do 120-150 km with a full tank. I also happened to ride it on the motorway at a constant speed thanks to the Cruisecontrol, in that case the distance extends up to 200-220km, but I assure you that this bike tastes best on extra-urban roads, mountain passes and so on .."
2923,"The tft instrumentation was great out of place. It could not be done worse! How do you recommend this bike? Zero Service Network, Future Resale unknown, Reliability a leap in the dark, Availability of spare parts and future of the brand ......... a Hamletic doubt! If only the son or grandson of the Indian dealer can buy it, other subjects would be at great risk!"
2924,"between a ducati and this one I would take this one hands down, I just don't like the tft (as I don't like in mine and in all motorcycles). I repeat, I have a different bike for my different needs, but this bike is wonderful. Spare parts, if you know the US market, are not a problem. Then if uni chooses the bike x the brand, the value of the used one, x the service network will buy those 2 3 ubiquitous bikes on our streets. This is a motorcycle for enthusiasts."
2925,Amazing‚Ä¶ .a bike that doesn't risk becoming ‚Äúold‚Äù after a couple of years
2926,"I agree not to compare it to a Monster or R nine-t, but a nice comparison with the Scrambler 1100 could be there!"
2927,"Aesthetically perfect, on the road it is super. The high wheels give it stability even when cornering, the section is right, you have to give up a little agility but it's not a GP bike so it's perfect. The driving position is very comfortable with the handlebars high and straight ... having 17k ‚Ç¨ left over, I would buy it immediatelyüòú"
2928,Fascinating brand and motorcycle that is a bomb ... I must admit that I had thought about it
2929,"it's not my kind of bike but seen live and really well done, like all the other indian models"
2930,Gorgeous bike. Consumption is also excellent
2931,"For me it is beautiful. Finally a ""narrow"" rear, which is a winner on the road."
2932,Too bad for the small tank compared to the displacement
2933,"in my opinion the real anomaly of this bike is the exaggeration of the engine. A smaller, lighter and less exuberant engine would probably have been more suitable. I'm afraid that flat track actually has little. As the Perfect says, this is a muscle bike [reads MASSOL!]."
2934,"While I was picking up my beautiful 500 trail leoncino from the dealer (also Indian office), I kept looking at it, displayed in the window and I must say that it distracted me a lot. Now that I know the easily understandable contents, I hold my Benelli tightly .. ... you're right, he's really a monster and he doesn't hide it, it really makes an impression. toast :)))"
2935,"A colleague of mine has just taken it, I have yet to see it but after the video I really like it, beautiful even outside, the engine seems to travel fast "
2936,"everything is perfect! Nice test, beautiful bike but there is little to do ... the 150 makes me fall my balls "
2937,"Timelessly fascinating, as per American tradition. Valid alternative to the usual Japanese and European ones. Too bad for the price ... too bad not to have them because it would definitely be in my dream garage with the Challenger"
2938,Fascinating motorcycle with character
2939,"Perfetto and very nice bike, having the money to buy immediately and even first to change the mirrors of the Graziella."
2940,"they paid a lot of attention to the weight! it can be deduced from how the plate holder is supported ahahahah XD having said that, for me one of the most fascinating bikes of recent years!"
2941,The license plate holder can actually be used as a trailer hitch. That alone will weigh 2.5 pounds
2942,"I have had various bikes, but the one that has remained in my heart is the Buell Lightning 984, which many despise, but a thousand times more fun than the Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple or the Super Duke (both had), obviously for my personal taste. This FTR tickles me ... definitely worth trying."
2943,I've been waiting for it for a lot and I love itüòç
2944,"Good morning, but for road use, can the rear rubber handle the power and torque of the bike? On asphalt, since no one in Europe will use it on land, wouldn't the 180 dinghy on circle 17 be better? Aesthetically it would also be much more beautiful, otherwise half gorgeous."
2945,"It reminds me of my XR1200, in the curves it is just like that! Beautiful bike!"
2946,"Just ordered .. I have been waiting for this test for a long time! I am a Ducati rider at heart but this bike fully hits the concept of freedom that a motorcycle must convey. You can do everything with it, it goes fast on the street, gives you some off-road trips, you can travel there, and by changing the tires you can even go to the track. Personally, given the driving position it would be more correct to compare it to the hypermotard .. but any comparison is wrong as we can consider it part of a single segment. My heart cries to give up my 796 transformed into s2r but this is the definitive bike. Too bad it was not built by ducats. Great perfect, a name a guarantee!"
2947,Tried one for a really fun full day. The only drawback is the traction control works well but in my opinion a little less refined than that available on European bikes and every now and then it gives a shot of gas by changing gear as if it wanted to do a sort of jointing but always late Another small flaw the translation of the LCD screen have translated track into track and not track.
2948,It's a particular bike but I like it‚úå
2949,"As a former owner of 2 standard HD XR 1200s, one of which is race prepared, ... GREAT INDIAN WORK!"
2950,It looks like an HD xr 1200 that I had a while ago .. The ugliest thing is the license plate holder. 
2951,"Even if it's not my thing, the bike is well done üëç‚úå"
2952,She's gorgeous!
2953,"Beautiful and could still have been beautiful even in 30 years, as a historic motorcycle, if it weren't for the ‚Äútablet‚Äù instrumentation, which at 30 will never get there. For me it would have been better an analogue instrumentation, retro style, more suited to the brand it carries"
2954,"Having the economic possibility, I would consider it only as a second bike, since it is aesthetically very beautiful. Why second bike? To travel? NO ... Track? NO ... home / office / home? NI (not a mistake ...) I mean you can do it but ... would you leave it on the sidewalk? 17,500 euros to do just a few shots on the mixed in the day (150 km of autonomy ....) To ME it seems too much! I find two things definitely out of tune: the TFT instrumentation which will be very useful and very readable but given the kind of bike I would be for the classic analogue and ... the license plate holder ... but come on ... it seems that they remembered it at the end and c 'they attached 4 pipes ..."
2955,great service great perfect
2956,"Beautiful intriguing, but I don't know if I really could have the courage to spend that money on this bike, I would probably go on a triumph exchanler 1200 xe, a real big dream. From an owner of a beautiful 2020 mt09."
2957,"really original and well done! It is one of a kind, a great gift given the large quantity of models (often all the same) on the market. Now that the engine is also approved, mmmm .... I wish .... who knows for the reliability and availability of engine parts and bodywork, all Indian .."
2958,Spectacular :)
2959,"I tested it at the Legend Bikers Dealership in Laglio Bergamo, and I say it's really fantastic. I recommend it to those who want and are looking for a bike with ... the attributes .... even if in my opinion, I would change the knobby tires, even if they have good road holding, with the road ones, which are even more reassuring for me. And then I would put the plate attached to the tail, thus completing the sporty line it deserves. I would buy it immediately, but I already have an Indian Scout and two other Honda bikes and then ..... I'm 71 years old. I have always ridden the bike, I know it in all its facets and seeing this video of the FTR 1200S even more trying it, I allowed myself these considerations."
2960,fantastic bike!
2961,"I understand that it has other dimensions of the rims, but it must also be said that the lattice frame and the swingarm are very reminiscent of Italian bikes, not only Ducati, but also Bimota for the swingarm. Remember, it doesn't mean identical. As for the instrumentation, honestly, the one with the round tachometer is sportier to me‚Ä¶"
2962,great beautiful bike!
2963,"Beautiful bike is well told. The video flows without us noticing the time passing. But apart from the tires .... it looks like a Monster. Echeccacchio, from the Perfetto ... the round of manifolds, the twin cylinder ..."
2964,"What a spectacular bike. Too bad for the ugly instrumentation that seems to be stuck there at random, and personally I would have preferred a 160 or 180 rear tire. But anyway, nonsense about a big toy like that. Having it, I would immediately throw the exhaust complete with collectors, sports filter and a revisit to the control unit, I would not sell it anymore."
2965,"I have two sensations: it widens the trajectories and it seems that it takes a while to make them change trajectory, perhaps due to the diameter of the front wheel. I don't like the instrumentation."
2966,"I am not convinced by this bike, but there is something for everyone, as they say. I do not know, however in my opinion that bike ""celebrates"" only the Flat Track, as it is too heavy; and okay it's a bit like saying that the GS is a bike for African rallies. However, the question is another: why should you choose this over a Diavel or a Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTwin or ... a Bandit 1250 (about 100 nm at 3800 days :-)))? I'm joking, but even if I don't want to spend 17k for a bike, I think I would think more about a used Diavel. I have the feeling that in a territory like ours, I would enjoy it more. In testing US bikes I don't see many roads with curves :-))"
2967,A diavel ?? this in my opinion is more agile and beautiful
2968,the ftr drives me crazy
2969,No idea what you‚Äôre saying but that‚Äôs a cool bike!
2970,"... if there were no writing on the Indian tank, so at first glance it would look like a Ducati ... the copy of the monster ... the colors, the manifolds, nice the problem is the price. this version apart, I don't understand how do they manage the motorization, to homologate the exhausts of the hd? !!? ... here with us, if you find a fussy agent and the exhaust you have is not super original, you also risk seizure, but to them, who practically do not have the silencer, they let it pass because the booklet says Original üòâ"
2971,Gorgeous !! (license plate holder excluded ...)
2972,"Seen at Eicma, beautiful, a very European, very Italian design, I wouldn't be surprised if it came out of a local design center. I didn't make it so heavy, probably the 1200 engine is a Harley-style American that weighs a ton by itself, with a 700-800, about thirty kg less (ok, in part you can recover by changing the catalytic exhaust and the license plate holder. he doesn't joke), with more street tires, he would have hit the bull's-eye, But the Indians are all special, all very US-style, heavy, long, moped"
2973,Gorgeous
2974,The most beautiful bike ever
2975,"really beautiful, i live in florida and i ride a lot, never seen one, i don't know why it's not very successful, to tell the truth you don't even see many new harley models around but of this very zero. I may be the first, I like it a lot"
2976,Love at first sight !!!! üòçüòçüòç
2977,Finally a different bike .. now we are waiting for Harley to wake up and bring something on the market that does not mimic the 50s bikes ..
2978,Gorgeous....
2979,"Beautiful, however, the instrumentation was used as round as on the triumphs"
2980,Beautiful beautiful beautiful Out of the box!
2981,In my opinion the ktm 890r is better both for the bike itself and for the price
2982,the KTM doesn't look at how ugly it is while this Indian is beautiful
2983,Great USA bike
2984,"Well done aesthetically beautiful even if I don't like naked ... or similar ... but I think that with 17k eurini and passes without quick shift, euro 4, minimal display, engine that heats up a lot in the street, small tank, inconvenient for the passenger, without cornering abs .... well .... with that money with that displacement and those horses I take a triumph 1200 or a honda africa twin"
2985,WONDERFUL BIKE I OWN A BEAUTIFUL INDIAN SCOUT 1200 ALSO MY INDIAN AND GO SAFE
2986,beautiful...
2987,Not even given as a gift ........ no offense. Beauty is subjective
2988,Very beautiful but certainly not light.
2989,√® B E L L I S S I M A A A A A A A A A A!!!!
2990,Too boorish ... I like it!
2991,Aesthetically it looks a bit like a Monster. I didn't understand why they put an iPad in front of the handlebars ... well
2992,If it cost ‚Ç¨ 3/4000 less it would be very attractive.
2993,shame too bad ... the economic cable clutch.
2994,Bella!
2995,This bike cannot have a tft dashboard ...
2996,"in my opinion to make this bike they took the numbers at the lottery, I mean a 1200cc with 120hp and 116Nm of torque and up here ok, then the 13-liter tank. But with a 1200 and 13 liters where are you going? You are always at the gas station, all the more so since it is an American engine. Okay. Then he says that it is a bull and I believe it with 116 Nm of torque only then you say that it is not correct to compare it to a European naked a flat track bike ... the alarm bells began to ring ... 19 front wheel with the 120 and the rear wheel of 18 with rubber of 150. From 18 ?? But why?? But then from 150 ?? A 1200 that with those ""knobby"" and the torque of the engine and the weight of the bike that will be at least over 200kg literally makes no sense. Then the final gem, the price! 17000 euros ?? To go flat track? Aahahah."
2997,Wow
2998,The arrows on the license plate holder .... NooooooooOoOooo
2999,"this yes. ignorant bike, low tank ... a lot of power, fake knobby tires, very grumpy, for me it is perfect, it makes no sense and is therefore unattainable ... I would buy it"
3000,Beautiful ... even if at that price the boxter and the quality of the components of the BMW R nineT are better
3001,in my opinion she is very beautiful and funny
3002,I don't know what to say ..... I still don't like the twin.
3003,but it is a copy of the ducati
3004,"It will certainly not have the characteristics of a Monster but the line is a copy and paste between Monster and diavel, that speedometer and ugly and chip. The classic American bike i, which for me can do everything except motorcycles, but what is the point of those tires and those measures in Europe, in has a lot of torque ..... but only that is the positive note."
3005,"they have no imagination, toosec.meis a copy of Monsters üòë"
3006,This bike is so cool I can't get over it.
3007,Lovely bike. Really want Indian to keep developing these more modern bikes. Shows forward thinking that HD just can't compete with. Let's get some UK dealerships too. Great vid guys üëçüëçüëç
3008,"Salient points, and not being a hipster I'd take a z900 or anything Euro middleweight over this any day. But this does show a promising future for Indian if they keep developing bikes down this avenue instead of the chiefs etc"
3009,The things I like about this bike have been commented on by others as negatives such as the standard tyres or the size of the wheels or the swing arm. The things that make this bike different matter and are critical to the way the bike rides This bike is all about the engine for sure but these oddball things that hang of it go along way to create its character and make it fun and not just another machine chasing performance numbers or some dull utilitarian purpose
3010,"I have not seen a single bad review for this FTR.... any of them from the base model all the way up, not a single bad review."
3011,"""Its the type of bike you'll go for a test ride on and then sign the cheque"" I literally did this yesterday :D .... though added a lowering kit, far too high"
3012,"I test rode one the other week, I'm 180cm tall and I was on my toes."
3013,Nice looking bike ‚úäüèª
3014,"I really like this bike. I sat on one at a show and it felt perfect for me at 6'2"" but it should come with 17"" wheels and be at least 30 lbs lighter. It's step in the right direction but Americans just can't do lightweight. Heavy over engineering has it's place but motorcycles isn't one of them. And of course there is the price! ouch."
3015,I‚Äôm reading some horror stories about bad fueling.
3016,I wish this was a real carbon model with real carbon parts. Some BST‚Äôs or rotobox‚Äôs would be sweet on this bike.
3017,Cool looking bike....wish manufacturers would make more good looking standard/naked bikes capable of taking a pillion for more than an hour or 2!!.....not sure our lass would sit on the back of that to the south of france....
3018,Looks like a hooligan bike üëç
3019,I'm just in love with it haha
3020,"Looks amazing, but not for me as I need a commuter/tourer rather than a toy... (I'd get on if I won the lottery though!)"
3021,"the problem for me is the wheel size and available tires, you can't get any decent street rubber, I'm not being funny but are you going to take a near 15k, carbon clad bike that you've spent your hard-earned on off-road? You'd want to keep it mint! They have limited the bike."
3022,Can't take it seriously as a road bike with those tires on it
3023,would look better with spock wheels and black rims they're another ¬£1000 on top
3024,Beautiful bike. Hope its fast as f
3025,"It's a really good looking bike and I bet it's fun. But it's just too much money for what you get. If I wanted this style of bike I'd get a svartpillen or similar and pocket the ¬£7,000 I'd have left over!"
3026,"Well the husky to this is apples to oranges. You're talking a single cylinder 701 to a 1200 V twin before you even start considering everything else like ohlins suspension, brembo brakes and masters, Akrapovic cans, TFT display and electronics suites... top of range equipment means more $$$. By all means spend your money the way that makes sense to you but this bike is in a completely different class than the 701. Which personally I think the 701 is expensive for what you're actually getting."
3027,The bad part about the tank being under the seat is that filling the bike takes about 4 times as long as you'd expect and you have to squeeze the gas handle very gently or it'll splash all over.
3028,"One of the best looking bikes being made today. Too much power for what I'd use it for though. I'd love to see a 750cc version with ~75-100hp that gets 50+mpg. Something that competes more with the SV650 and Monster 794/821 class. 60% of my riding is city or sub-55mph and I just can't justify it. It would be really cool if the smaller cc version had a dirt/DS/desert sled flavor for light offroading. Would be a #1 pick for me! Also, they gotta change the company name soon, or donate % of profits to USA tribes. ""Indian"" is just really bad taste for an American bike that has no connection to the tribes. A shame, because they're so much better than HD!"
3029,The tires are for dirt too lol... swap em out of shes gonna be a pavement princess!
3030,"This is the only American bike I would ever consider, other than an original 750XR. I saw it live in a showroom in South Wales last summer and recognised immediately what a great bike it obviously is.¬† If Harley wasn't in a perpetual un-evolved cycle of pandering to old men with cloned beards, leather vests and a confused idea of freedom, firing their CEOs, and crying to Uncle Sam every decade or so when real bike manufacturers get it right, they might have made this bike 10 or 20 years ago."
3031,"Very cool bike but those wheels and tires put me off, I know it's based on a flat tracker but 99% will be ridden on the road by hipsters"
3032,"i'm not a hipster at all and i own this bike and ride it mainly on the road. Besides that, i agree the tyres are slippy when it's wet."
3033,125 BHP I would expect more from a 1200 cc that number plate and bracket its gotta go theirs gotta be a tale tidy available soon and the tyres
3034,"It really is a good looking bike. Indian know how to style, but don't know how to price üòÇ"
3035,Base model looks better
3036,"That low-slung, looks-like-it-was-slapped-on-as-an-afterthought number plate/rear indicator mounting is a no-no. The indicators will be invisible at traffic lights and junctions, or in slow-moving traffic, to following vehicles. Needs a hugger and a proper tail-tidy."
3037,That slim rear wheel and the swing arm just killed the style of the bike unfortunately
3038,Junk those tyres
3039,"Nobody mentions that when they're testing the bike but under wet conditions, they slip too easily... I wish we could have different tyres mounted and tested on this bike..."
3040,Even if I won the lottery I would never pay just under 15k for that. It‚Äôs a rip off. You could buy a brand new Thruxton R or RS for less than that and they are much better bikes.
3041,"It is a shame it is so ugly and looks like all the other cookie cutter bikes. They should have gone more retro or more classic looking. I think it is horrible. Then I don't like the Scout either because of the forward peg and low suspension, looks like a toy and from owners I've heard it is only a short distance ride, too uncomforatble. They should take the suspension and pegs from this and fit them to the Scout, then they would have a cool bike."
3042,"Cruise control has saved me from more than one ticket, I had a CHP follow me for miles and I could stay spot on the speed limit without stressing or looking at the speedometer. Kinda keeps you in check when you daydream then look down and you're cruising 90 without trying."
3043,"I like this bike, seems pretty cool. Indian also appear to be much more progressive & market aware than Harley."
3044,"I love the Indian FTR, they've done a great job designing and improving it over time"
3045,The biggest deterrent for me is the tank size/mpg. Otherwise I love everything else about the bike
3046,Cruise control is pretty much a must have for me at this point. Hard to see myself buying another bike without it.
3047,As far as that exhaust - blame emission standards. Once uncorked though that engine makes some of the best sounds ive ever heard.
3048,"This bike looks awesome, give it long travel, comfortable suspensions and a larger tank and it's a no brainer."
3049,I have the Rally version with rear rack and side bag rack. It's very versatile and cuts a line between a true ADV and a Sport Bike. It's a unique creature. Not sure I'd like the chopped ride height of the new version.
3050,"Compared to a Harley, most bang for the buck. Stability control with IMU standard just like cars. Great bike for the MSRP"
3051,The previous model was gorgeous with some real dirt/adventure credibility. This one not so much. Previous gen must not have sold very well to change it so drastically
3052,I‚Äôve had the base model (2019 ver) for a few months now and the only thing that annoys me is how the analogue speedo hangs over the ignition. Kinda fiddly to get a key in there when it‚Äôs on a keyring with other keys.
3053,I noticed the clutch engagement issue with the original version as well and found the bike challenging to launch smoothly. I also stalled the bike a bunch of times at first too. I'm disappointed that Indian didn't address this issue with the update...
3054,It‚Äôs a bike that begs you to get silly but a price tag that begs you to keep it calm
3055,I'm interested in the Rally version. I like to go on dirt roads sometimes. Plenty of twisties and unpaved roads where I live.
3056,"wow, never thought i would say something like this, but this indian motorcycle looks amazing! also bike is so low, that it appears that you are actually going waaay faster than you really were there."
3057,I love the aesthetic of this bike and I think this will be my second bike to partner my GSA.
3058,"The loss of suspension travel seems like a really bad move. We know this isn‚Äôt a sport bike, you aren‚Äôt tracking an FTR, it‚Äôs a pot hole, city stomper."
3059,I like it. 
3060,Nice to have cruise whether you use it or not. Nice to have a rest once and awhile especially with the newer radar cruise arriving to more bikes
3061,I like this engine with a Bassani low mount pipe.
3062,I agree with you 100% that this bike needs a gearing change. When I rode one I had the same feeling at freeway speeds. This was not relaxing to say the least.
3063,"It's good that the seat hight is 'low', we are all not 6 foot tall üòÅ. It's also good that there is some European componentry on the bike, I have always found American bikes a bit 'agricultural' in design, specs and performance, "
3064,If only there was a nicely styled proper front mudguard - the stock one seems virtually pointless üòé
3065,"This seems like one of the best bikes to come along in a long time that probably won't sell very well.m afraid you‚Äôre right. I live in a big city and have yet to see one out on the road since it‚Äôs introduction.

"
3066,"I had considered a prior year FTR, hoping it would make a great all-arounder, but it was way too tall for my short legs. I wasn't crazy about the tires either since I'm a road-only rider. Perhaps Indian finally realized people weren't buying these to use as adventure bikes, and turned the bike into more of a naked sportbike, and it looks like the results are very good"
3067,That's one beautiful motorcycle üòç
3068,Fuel economy and emissions tests are set for slower than real world speeds. Hence not the gearing some would like.
3069,The 17 wheels are a massive visual improvement
3070,Sexy looking bike and it hits all the bases but the fuel capacities. Reminds me of my first gen V-max were I had to preplan my fuel stops.
3071,This engine (same as Scout) is more suitable for a cruiser or maybe even an ADV bike like the V-Strom. The bike nevertheless is very unique.
3072,It seems like indian made a bike to suit any rider. I'm sure the aftermarket will accommodate the noise makers at the back. Big V-Twins are fun to ride in a smaller chassis. Not sure if the looks will grow on me but it appears to be a great bike.
3073,I use mine (2019) as a commuter and love it. The only thing I don't like is that it makes you want to go fast. I have never been a speed demon but you'll hit a 100 every time you pass a semi...
3074,"Seems kind of a strange choice of wheels, tyres and suspension nerf for a bike that was fun on gravel. I guess the fun is over."
3075,Good steering lock. Since I'm not a fan of 3 point turns on steep gravel parking lots.
3076,"Love the new features, just give me the old 33"" seat height. Might be better for the passenger, too!33 inches is low from my riding experience.  I'm used to barely touching the ground. But most bikers are candy a-- and can't handle a proper off road suspension."
3077,The most beautiful bike ever made
3078,Lower bar and different mirrors would make it look even better. Pretty slick bike
3079,"i know it's not a huge change but....the wheel size change was a mistake looks wise. i know performance wise it's a thing, but, it looses a lot of the flat tracker look even with that small of a change. also the rake change goes into the same visual change. still....pretty much one of the most beautiful motorcycles built in quite some time"
3080,"Pretty negative review compared to the rest of the reviews out there, really like that FTR1200 though, looks really good and has plenty of performance. The price is the main issue with the bike, it could be a little more competitive, especially as most of us know Indian shops don't really do discounts. So you could probably get equivalent bikes for less...."
3081,"I did NOT like the brake response on the FTR, and I also didn't like how tough it was to press the lever."
3082,I can't decide how I feel about these low mounted license plates. I certainly like that not all manufacturers are doing those ugly tails.
3083,Man this bike seems cool. But ide like to see Indian do two things. Make a 750 little brother for it. And make a sport bike platform with them. Maybe some neo-retro style fairings. Kind of similar to the z900rs
3084,"Indian really missed an obvious opportunity to make a light weight flat tracker style bike closer to the race bike : 750cc engine 180kg (400lbs) weight minimalist styling especially get rid of the fugly mufflers affordable price Instead they built another overpriced , overweight fussy looking boring cruiser"
3085,It honestly seems like a pretty bad bike for $16k. But from a purely aesthetic perspective it's my favorite looking bike.
3086,"For the price, the Indian is the better deal with all the electronics and cruise control. What turned me off was the exhaust. It looks like someone spray painted them in a matte gold. It looked cheap and not shiny. Maybe they have a coating on them??? IDK. I saw some of the older models with blemishes on the pipes so again IDK. Anyway, if it were me, for the money I'd get the base black for $12,999. That paint job was killer. Of course the Carbon looks sharp but Ohlins and a seat and carbon aren't worth $4k more, sorry. The Rally version still has the longest travel suspension front and rear."
3087,Love everything but the rear fender
3088,As someone who owns a 2019 FTR 1200 s I am somewhat disappointed that they took away the olens from the s model
3089,its sad how easily this bike starts up. My R1 takes 5 x longer and thats on a warm day. That one touch is pretty damn impressive.
3090,I think the 17 inchers make the bike look odd
3091,"My real question is about pricing. If the programming is already done with Indian's cruisers and it's drive-by-wire anyway, cruise control is basically free. Sure, but if I'm paying up for ""features"" on a bike that I'm purchasing for it's racing pedigree not it's ability to cruise, then no. Great video as always and Zach is top of his class on motorcycle ride evaluations. "
3092,The bike is awesome. But everyone i know that owned one sold it. Fuel tank is WAY too small
3093,"Indian really missed an obvious opportunity to make a light weight flat tracker style bike closer to the race bike (which is a really cool high performance bike): 750cc engine 180kg (400lbs) weight minimalist styling especially get rid of the fugly mufflers affordable price Instead they built another overpriced , overweight fussy looking boring cruiser"
3094,Those brake lines look unusually dangly.
3095,this is pretty much the only American bike that i would consider
3096,"When I test rode the bike, it felt like a hooligan bike... maybe due to the fine clutch zone and torque available. It was a fun bike and I enjoyed the ride. Hopefully they increase the fuel tank size because I felt that was the biggest limiting factor for me on why I wouldn't buy the bike. Other than that it is a great contender"
3097,Fuel tank size is a contentious point that makes me hesitate on many motorcycles I would otherwise purchase. I need at LEAST 4 gallons minimum for making a consideration as a primary bike.
3098,That bike desperately needs another gear.
3099,"Honestly still like the bike, but it's lost its character that I loved by shrinking the tires etc. I get it all raises performance but something about the setup before was even just pleasing to the eye"
3100,"This is definitely not a pillion bike. Those footrests are too high. Even with the aviator seat, I wouldn't want to carry a pillion for any length of time. It's a rider's bike. As for the brakes, I find the bite fine. Nice and progressive. Handling is like it's on rails. I agree, this is very much a competitor in the European market. Harley had this with the Bronx but they bottled it, handing this segment to Indian who must be rubbing their hands in glee. On balance, probably the nicest bike I've ridden and owned."
3101,The FTR is far prettier
3102,I want a FTR are bad but I will not buy one until somebody addresses the low capacity fuel tank. That is something that the individual cannot easily correct with aftermarket products until someone comes out with a solution Indian or aftermarket.
3103,i think it looks weird and kinda off with the smaller wheels
3104,Kinda disappointed. dont like the decreased suspension travel and visually i dont like the smaller tires. Before it was unique and you could tell its heritage with flat track. This just looks like a naked bike....
3105,"Poor range, not enough suspension travel, no centre stand, luggage hard to fit. nah. Better things to spend 15k on. Looks cool."
3106,"Unpopular opinion - the first version of this bike was better. The last version the only real complaints were that the fueling, especially when cold, was awful and the tires while stylish were junk. I feel like the older style bike just made a great road machine. Comfortable, stable, looked awesome, and totally fit as its own neo retro niche. This update made it go from filling that niche perfectly to making it more of a heavy compromised naked bike. I think rather than spend all that time adjusting the geometry to so that the 17's could work they should instead focused on sourcing slightly more road focused tires for the older style."
3107,"Small fuel capacity sort of ruins otherwise great bikes. Stop messin' with my fuel range, ya moron manufacturers! Cruise control question, exactly as you said. It's there if you want to use it, absolutely not in the way if you don't. A ZX-10R or S1000RR superbike has a cruise control these days."
3108,"I have heard some horror stories about the engine's reliability. Can you share some here? Failures to start, repeated cold stalling, low rpm throttle surges (which is the worst time for that little adventure), and inconsistent fuelling.That‚Äôs not really reliability, but driveability, which I would find annoying and unacceptable for what it‚Äôs costs.  However, those issues have supposedly been rectified with this latest generation.

"
3109,So much unnecessary tech. Especially the cylinder deactivation. Most people who mod their cars will deactivate that feature on their car.
3110,That's a shame about the range.
3111,For an akro exhaust that shit is stupid quiet. Kinda disappointing. 
3112,Nice silent ride.
3113,Overpriced tor a basic motorcycle with cruise control. Looks nice though.
3114,Nice and a head light that dosen't look like it's a bug transformer or in need of a bra.
3115,Overall styling is not good from the seat back.
3116,"What about rain on the dash touch capability.I‚Äôve been caught in the rain a couple times, no issue. I keep mine in the shed though so I‚Äôm not sure how it would fair with sitting outside in constant rain and sunshine over a few years"
3117,Sprinkled with some Monster left overs and Monster wanna be.
3118,"Looks really tacky build quality and that radiator looks rubbish! Not even in the same league as Triumph and Ducati. They really need to look at a better TFT, cable routing, switch gear quality general fit and finish not as good as Triumph or H-D etc. And way too much money for what you get.Agreed! The Triumph Speed Twin manages to tuck in all the bits and look clean, trim and tidy. The FTR looks too unfinished/industrial, with those radiator cowls sticking out, the header heat shield (which hit my leg), the EVAP canister, the battery and some drain hose hanging down, and that monstrosity hanging below the seat (which is too low for the turn signals to be easily seen). Lastly unappealing colors: matte white or burgundy/maroon? How about a bright red? Looks wise, "
3119,"I think Indian bonked this one. The whole point of this bike was the flat track thing, and now is just another naked sport bike. Dont know, guess a bit of an unpopular opinion."
3120,Horrible fuel mileage!
3121,the only thing i want changed in this bike is the puny fuel tank.A bigger tank would make the bike look not as good.
3122,"So, from what I heard - not geared well, fiddly clutch, unusable for pillion, very small tank, harsh suspension, brakes underpowered ... gee, just $15k for all that goodness?"
3123,I own this bike. Its garbage! Dies multiple times during start up. Mine has a horrible knock when cold and throws misfire codes. I took it to a dealership and they kept it for 27 days trying to figure it out. Indian said its bc it's a race derived engine and won't do anything about it. I will never buy Indian again!
3124,"I want to really like this bike, but it just looks awkward, the massive radiator setup, the 2 huge mufflers. It looks like a mutated cruiser, not a flat track bike. IMO kind of a miss by Indian, who is otherwise cranking out great bike after great bike."
3125,"Nice looking bike but 15k is just nuts. Cables just rubber tied to the handlebar, over 500lbs. CB1000R or Street Triple over this any day for less $$."
3126,nteresting bike but 15k price tag is kinda pushing it.
3127,"One expensive, slow, heavy naked bike..but have the advertising of it throw around words like , ""urban dirt tracker"". People will love and over pay for it...haha"
3128,"So it's like my old ZRX1200 with better suspension, electronics but worse gas mileage and range. Pillion? Indian might as well have sprinkled broken glass on the rear seat section."
3129,Ability to use touchscreen on motorcycle while it is in motion should not be available. Otherwise good review.
3130,Super lame 17 inch rim change
3131,Looks like another very uncomfortable motorcycle from Indian build for going to the bar but not much else. If they're not careful they'll end up like Harley Davidson.
3132,"The throttle control is fantastic, so the bike is great around traffic and will also launch with a little more twist of the throttle. The modes can be easily changed on the run by pushing a button which is very useful. The bike also works well for tall people, as you can grab the tank really well with your knees and gives great control when cornering. (just add tank pads to stop scratching the tank) Wasn't really mentioned but you get a significant boost in torque and power at 7,000 rpm which is quite fun, enough to lift the front wheel."
3133,True compared to its other naked counter parts there this stands out as being practical and manageable on and off the road. Made my choice between this and SDR 1290. CB1000R is my choice. Hats off to ya guys and thanks for this vid
3134,The fact that you can customize engine braking/traction control and power is pretty cool. This can give a rider options depending on where they‚Äôre riding... my only ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù would be the front fender which is matte black. I wish it matched the tank. Looking at it I can see Honda tried to tie the color of the fender into the engine area. Wouldn‚Äôt stop me from buying one either way! 
3135,"Thank you Honda for a motorcycle that is modern without looking like a bug, alien, robot, boy-racer, or cartoonish caricature of a motorcycle. Looks are subjective but as a former Honda guy from the 70's and V4 80's I love the styling of this bike. And after niggles with certain Italian makes I am happy to finally return to Honda. I expect this bike to look as good years from now as the original CB750 does today."
3136,Brilliant bike! Personally preferred it to the mt10 too. Loads of fun!
3137,"Having gone from Honda to Yamaha i definitely miss the smoothness and ability the Honda had when pushed hardest. No matter what the road throws at you a Honda will always keep its balance and footing. Almost like a well rounded boxer. The accuracy offsets the power it lacks, that many boast of."
3138,"I have had my CB1000R for just over a week now and after having ridden it on motorways @70mph, main roads and in town it is very much living up to my expectations and beyond. Standard mode offers increased response over rain mode (I am yet to try sport mode or define user mode) both offer linear delivery of controllable power to keep up with and ahead of traffic accompanied by a low hum, pops and burbles from the exhaust / airbox when shifting up and down the gearbox. As I am still running in the engine I am still to enjoy the engine note and power delivery after 5,500 revs+ which I wait for in anticipation in the near future. Interesting to note that the mpg is increasing showing 41 mpg at present which I am very happy with and I can only assume will increase. The bike is very easy to flick and change direction and filtering is a joy as you are able to do so without any drama. The LCD screen is very easy to read and contains all the information you need and through the controls you are ale to access it and alter the modes whilst on the fly. As you can tell I am very happy with my decision to get a Honda CB 1000R and am looking forward to 2020 when in Warner weather in the UK I will be able to use it. I would highly recommend this well equipped, well put together motorcycle as it will put a smile on your face time and time again."
3139,"Studied this bike for a year and just had to have one.¬† Traded in a VFR1200f for a 2018 black.¬† Too much silver, though - blacked out everything and it's a real head-turner.¬† No, it's not the baddest bike on the block, but it's the prettiest, and¬†145 HP is plenty if you don't spend time at the track.¬† Plenty of torque in any gear - even in 6th at 25 MPH, smooth and strong acceleration.¬† Got choices of power modes, but I keep it mostly in ""standard"".¬† I absolutely love this bike.¬† 467 pounds is much more fun than 600 pounds, and it'll keep up with the VFR up to 80 MPH.¬† I mean, really, who needs to go 170 MPH on the street?"
3140,
3141,"Nice review gents. A steering damper is a compromise, the lack of it means Honda have got the geometry of the bike correct"
3142,"It all comes down to taste I think. But coming off a previous gen CB1000r, and now riding a ‚Äò17 Tuono Factory I can say this: the old CB had much nicer design, and I‚Äôll do circles around this new bike on my Tuono üòÇ had I kept my older CB1000r I wouldn‚Äôt be upgrading to this bike ..."
3143,Id rather go with the z900rs its cheaper and looks much nicer. Sure the Kawi makes less power but it still has more than anyone needs. That Hondas great though hope to see it on the road.
3144,"As someone looking to purchase a liter bike in the coming months coming from a 600cc. I've narrowed my options down to the z900rs, possibly the new supercharged version of the z900 and the CB 1000r. Do you think it is going to be too large of a step from an older 600cc to the 1000cc and which would you recommend? Cheers"
3145,Much better looking then the mt10 but I think I‚Äôd still go the mt10 for that R1 engine
3146,yes the Sound of the Crossplane Engine is so great
3147,It's so beautiful i want to cry.
3148,I liking the flat head light never liked pointy head lights sticking out looks cleaner this way
3149,"Good Review but agreed , why Honda can't put decent mirrors on ?? I had to change out mine too on my cb650f as my arms took up much of the glass , please think more about safety Honda !"
3150,"All the near liter class bikes have more power than anyone needs... but you get used to it pretty quickly. I agree with other poster's that the Z900rs classic UJM looks are dialed in perfectly - this bike would need to grow on me... it looks like Honda wanted to be audacious like the MT-10 but couldn't quite build up enough courage. I'll have to reserve comment on performance until I get a chance to ride the Honda... but when I hear ""easier to ride"" and ""manageable power"" from online reviewers, to me that's positive spin on ""not enough power""."
3151,Looks like the styling was inspired by the Ducati Scramblers(803 & 1100)
3152,Everything is lovely but that headlight. I'd replace it with the older chrome headlight much more authentic looking
3153,It's so beautiful i want to cry.
3154," I went yesterday 09/12 to try the Z900rs in black color .... was in my wish list and had to give it a try so I did...didnt like the riding style of the bike, by that I mean from my point of view, bike is a bit jerky for a everyday city driving, handlebars have a not so easy to get use position, seat is not comfortable at all (and I ride a cbr1000) there is no doubt the bike has the power and torque for a spirit riding but is not definitely a commute bike, too harsh, too jerky, and the brakes u have to squeeze them hard all the time to stop the bike, so to wrap it up, I like the looks of the bike, but ridding just didn't make the cut for me. I love Honda engineering, smooth, responsive and powerful, honda has all u need for a track day or commute riding around t city"
3155,very beautiful bike
3156,Honda engine is soo beautiful. Not just an engine but engineered amazingly. Looks amazing and as always honda sounds amazing
3157,Killer looks
3158,I like this fantastic bike
3159,"A steering damper is a compromise, the lack of it means Honda have got the geometry of the bike correct."
3160,"It‚Äôs definitely a more tamable machine compared to that of the MT10, however that being said it still delivers that excitement and rush of a super naked. I think you‚Äôll enjoy it üòâ Oh and it‚Äôs much better on fuel consumption haha"
3161,"Damn this bike is damn gorgeous, I was thinking to get a iron 883 HD but damn I think I‚Äôm gonna get this beauty"
3162,Nice bike and a good review of it. But when is Honda going to start offering parallel twins of various displacements to compete with RE and Triumph?
3163,"It all comes down to taste I think. But coming off a previous gen CB1000r, and now riding a ‚Äò17 Tuono Factory I can say this: the old CB had much nicer design, and I‚Äôll do circles around this new bike on my Tuono üòÇ had I kept my older CB1000r I wouldn‚Äôt be upgrading to this bike ..."
3164,Excellent review .... kick stand and mirror problems ..... absolutely ... you are right
3165,holy mother of damnation that's a gorgeous bike!
3166,Waiting for the 2019 - looked really hard at the BMW Rnine t and 1200r - this has a better price point. Hell even Harley is going to have a street fighter - this is a new category of motorcycle- very exciting.
3167,it deserves more hype then most motorcycles out there. Such an incredible machine!
3168,"As someone looking to purchase a liter bike in the coming months coming from a 600cc.

3169,Much better looking then the mt10 but I think I‚Äôd still go the mt10 for that R1 engine
3170,"So Beautiful, UAU amazing bike!"
3171,"People that rag this bike or bikes like it. need to stop judging bikes by paper stats and ride them. And its a beautiful machine. Who cares if its got an old honda motor that's been updated or if its ""only"" got 140hp"
3172,"I just ordered the black today, I liked it, based on the aesthetics of the bike, and the feel of it, it‚Äôs very comfortable, so I‚Äôm so excited to get it, in a few days time, its being order in. I like the red but I think the black looks better. I just paid $18,000 all up on road."
3173,. I am really intrigued by this mass-forward muscle look. Keeping this in the top of my list for next bike. Cheers fellas
3174,If I wasn't buying a z900rs I would get one of these instead. In regards to its rideability honda have always been fairly tame.
3175,"You should try this bike. I was on the fence between this and the Z900RS, I rode both and this is a lot bette"
3176,"Same story here, I haven't tried either one but I'm still deciding which one (mt-09 vs cb1000r vs Z900RS). I'm living where it's hard to test ride because the dealer afraid their bikes will lose value. It's dumb, so I have to watch a lot of video on Youtube and reading comments to help me make the decision"
3177,I liking the flat head light never liked pointy head lights sticking out looks cleaner this way
3178,"Good Review but agreed , why Honda can't put decent mirrors on ?? I had to change out mine too on my cb650f as my arms took up much of the glass , please think more about safety Honda !"

3181,Everything is lovely but that headlight. I'd replace it with the older chrome headlight much more authentic looking
3182,"When are Honda going to make a modern straight six powered bike to pay homage to the legendary (imho) CBX1100? Now that, would be a best in class seller"
3183,It's a neo classics...not absolutely a classics.... maybe Honda will open an new era of motorcycle designing
3184,"I went yesterday 09/12 to try the Z900rs in black color .... was in my wish list and had to give it a try so I did...didnt like the riding style of the bike, by that I mean from my point of view, bike is a bit jerky for a everyday city driving, handlebars have a not so easy to get use position, seat is not comfortable at all (and I ride a cbr1000) there is no doubt the bike has the power and torque for a spirit riding but is not definitely a commute bike, too harsh, too jerky, and the brakes u have to squeeze them hard all the time to stop the bike, so to wrap it up, I like the looks of the bike, but ridding just didn't make the cut for me.

3185,Hate number plate position area it should be where the indicator are normally number plated
3186,Looks like a compelling machine. But I don't really get the allure of that much power without fairings. Wind blast alone will ensure you only use at most 60% of the bike's potential. For the same price you could have a Street Triple that is a much better overall package and an engine you can actually give a workout.
3187,It is gorgeous
3188,Nice bike except headlight and rearlight are too grandpa like
3189,"Looks like the xDiavel S, esp. that sideview"
3190,I see a little bit of a resemblance. What caught me off guard is the rear hugger license plate holder
3191,Gorgeous
3192,Something wrong with the indicators. They're on all the time. Also the horn button is in the wrong place.
3193,this bike is so pretty
3194,Sick bike but that exhaust looks terrible
3195,How big is the tank? I'd love to throw a Ventura rack and packs on this thing and make it a naked tourer like my beloved '03 Tuono
3196,"Only downer I've noticed as yet. It's 16L, and pain having to fill up on wkend ride when Fireblade riders don't."
3197,I agree on the mirrors. And that's also the only thing that annoys me.
3198,Its perfect for a tall rider im 180cm tall and on it my legs are fully stretched
3199,no mention of the tyres? thats cause i believe this comes with the same crap tyres as my z900. worst tyres iv had zero feel and shit traction. guess they had to cut costs somewhere.
3200,this bike is a proof that every major company produce bikes with their current stock items. like bulbs forks etc. looks like honda run out of stock items then they bouqht new qoodies.
3201,Maybe i change the side mirror
3202,Honda engine zero maintenanc
3203,I had a 2005 cbr600rr that I bought with 20k miles and put 20k more on and that bike never missed a beat even in the middle of winter. I beat that thing to shit and it always performed. Ive got an 08 cbr1000rr and its the same story. Ive got nothing but good things to say about Honda.
3204,Suzuki Gsx s1000 is faster lighter with better mpg the only thumbs up that cb1000r has is the looks and the idea behind everything honda did a good job just could have done better on refining the engine
3205,"So where is the aftermarket support for this bike, it needs a new pipe that doesn't look like a big ugly box."
3206,Looks like a movie prop
3207,"All the electronics, but no cruise control?"
3208,"R Zu yeah it is a little upsetting that it doesn't come standard with cruise control, but the very first thing I would put on this bike is a radiator guard!"
3209,By unique style do you mean by Honda only? Because naked bikes have been around for awhile
3210,"lol I don't know how you gathered that idea but yes we are referring to the actual style CB itself, not the type of bike."
3211,Just from a test ride on this new CB 1000r plus ..I was disappointed I found it quite dull compared to my Kawasaki Z1000 ..I was all set to buy it but there you go that's why you must test before buying
3212,Powerdelivery is very linear and smooth. 
3213,"Very ordinary bike, nothing outstanding, not bad but not great. I could see people trading these in after a few months as the novelty wears off"
3214,Dude doesn't have a more beautiful bike than this CB 1000 barracuda. dream!
3215,Most beautiful cb1000 ever
3216,"Can you just tell us about your feelings in direct comparison with the 650? Braking, motor behavior and precision on the angle in particular. Is there such a big gap between the two? Thank you in advance!"
3217,"Apart from the engine, the biggest difference is felt in fast curves where the 1000 is more stable and therefore encourages you to pass harder: In turns the 1000 is more lively and at the same time more stable than the 650, so it lands more easily but requires a bit more commitment to rectify a trajectory. At low speed the 1000 also seems more agile to me, possibly because of the tighter caster angle but especially the profile of the tires. The damping is also significantly better on the 1000: The rear in particular, even if it is set a little soft when leaving the factory, makes it possible to better maintain the wheel on the ground in bumpy turns where in these same turns the 650 tended to twitch (gently). The braking is comparable I find, there is probably a little more attack on the 1000 but the feeling is very similar. Comfort, especially in duo (according to my wife) is better on the 1000 mainly due to a more padded and slightly more spacious saddle. The riding positions are comparable, we are slightly further forward on the 1000. Finally, the engine is what separates the two bikes the most, firstly because the 1000 allows you to roll up in all circumstances with always enough by force whatever the traffic where the 650 sometimes asks to go down one or two gears but also because above 6000 rpm we find the somewhat on/off temperament of the 650 but in a much wilder way. In the end, the 1000 is the same philosophy as the 650 with the bar placed higher on each criterion. That being said, the 650 is a really great bike that I can't say enough about personally. Completely consistent, healthy, well equipped, efficient... I don't see any gap between the 650 and the 1000, but the second as an improvement on the first. The 1000 is just ""the same and better"" in fact. ‚úå‚úå"
3218,"Thank you very much for this feedback which answers all my questions! I receive my 650 in full in 2 weeks and I hesitated with the 1000, but for a first motorcycle in license A I do not think I lack power, at least at the beginning. I tried it in A2 and I found it a little soft, but a 4-legged bridled necessarily is softer than a bi. Question look, both are beautiful, the 1000 is bigger, which I personally like. How does the original 1000 sound compared to the original 650? "
3219,"Having had the opportunity to try the 650 in A2 I can tell you that the full has absolutely nothing to do, it's no longer the same bike. The 650 is a great choice in A, whether you're ""young A"" or not, the reason I switched to the 1000 is that I do less town (where the 1000 is a little oversized) than before and then, it's a little whim to be honest but the 650 is really a great wheel, you'll have fun with it. Sound level the 1000 makes more noise than the basic 650 and that is also found with the lines: the 1000 with the silencer and db-killer makes more noise when I open wide than the 650 which had a totally Arrow line empty."
3220,"Don't worry too much about that either; the ""mini-steering"" I objectively provoked it by opening wide on the relief, it is very far from being systematic and when it happens it is so light that it is neutralized immediately by reducing a little throttle opening. At worst you can avoid opening wide on the lower gears if the ground is not perfect, even at 2/3 opening you will have no trouble fitting in, believe me üòÑ It's normal on such powerful motorcycles with this geometry of having a front that is a little agitated sometimes, you just have to know it, it's a very healthy motorcycle I think "
3221,"I confirm you say, it is an excellent bike. After a year and 9000 km I have found only 2 ""faults"" in it: - the behavior in serious arsouille mode on degraded roads, you have to hold it well and keep a cool head (at the same time what an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãarsouillement on rotten roads ‚Ä¶lol). - comfort, even if very correct for this kind of bike and in the face of competition, you still have to rest your buttocks after 200 km or 2 hours on the road. The hardest part (for me) is to stay reasonable, the engine beyond 6000 is simply enjoyable... In short, for those who hesitate, only a test will convince you üòÅ Ride safe friend ‚úåÔ∏è "
3222,Strong machine and strong test team! And nobody needs 200hp in a naked! Except for people who lack self-confidence and confuse sheer horsepower with driving pleasure. That's why I find the new S1000 R so attractive. Many thanks here to BMW!
3223,Was the color of the last model. It's amazing how prone to scratches a paintwork can be. Everything was full of micro-scratches just from normal cleaning. I also found the strut a bit under-damped and the extra boost at 6.5K was also kind of weird. I didn't think QS was that bad. Don't think anything has changed either. ;) But all in all good update. Display finally contemporary.
3224,"The short tail looks fantastic. The exhaust also looks nice and compact for Euro 5 - I know worse pots. The CB seems to be a little insider tip, because the same mopeds are always being discussed, such as the S1000RR, Super Duke, Tuono, etc. And 145 hp are really enough on country roads. My Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãTriple has 140 hp, but 10 Nm more and also pulls like hell. Nobody needs more. And for ‚Ç¨13,000, the CB is almost a bargain."
3225,"I had to decide between the honda and the vitpilen last year. both machines have the same problem: they are too pretty. everything styled, that sucks a little. nevertheless it works very well. the decision to go for the weaker machine is much more important because you have just as much fun with it and you only get 140 at most. you know the other thing: a short lift, 160 like nothing, and although totally safe and harmless, a driver's license for a few months... downgrading is the trick for me. if you still want the honda (like me after this video), 145ps are perfectly adequate, you can only agree with zonko unconditionally. and the wing logo on the tank is so classy as to kneel down!"
3226,"I'm completely with you regarding the connectivity. When I ride a motorcycle, I want to concentrate on the essentials, and that's riding. Although I'm a Suzuki fan, I find this Honda quite beautiful. But I would find an ""analog"" speedometer nicer."
3227,"In some tests of the CB1000R, for example that of ""Motorradonline"", there are actually reports of a strong speed drop or a strange power development with the CB1000R. Has anyone in the community who has been able to ride this machine experienced or can confirm this issue? with 146 HP there is no problem on the country road. From 8,000 tours it almost tears you out of the saddle. The gears are translated a bit too short: in the sixth exactly 4,000 revolutions at 100 km/h - that's annoying on the motorway."
3228,Very nice...great bike especially in this black edition
3229,"I've had mine since March 2020, I'm completely thrilled. Up to 6000 she drives like a motorcycle, but then... Holla the forest fairy... but manageable. In addition, no jerking in the speed range, just Honda. Even suitable for bikers with 1.85 m."
3230,"Looks nice. But 145hp...would be too much for me. In the curves, that doesn't do you much good either, if most of them with their overpowered bikes don't even know that you're approaching a curve from the outside, you could have paid attention in physics class (apex). But really great device: o And the video is great, it's just fun to watch you and your know-how is great"
3231,4 cylinders are super elastic. A really great bike.
3232,"Super pretty motorbike. Short license plate holder, passenger cover up, passenger footrests removed and with Arrow exhaust. So the part will be with me next month <3"
3233,"The flyscreen is really not pretty, but otherwise it looks much better now than beforeüòÉ"
3234,"Was allowed to try the previous model and have to say that the Black Edition is missing a few color accents, although I like black. The automatic gearshift also worked very well on my copy and I was enthusiastic about the test drive. Challenges sporty drivers without overtaxing idlers. I find the design extremely successful. The price is a bit too high for me (in Austria) at over EUR 16,000.00 and if I could wish for something, it would be 300ccm more and a bit more rear for passenger and luggage."
3235,The rims üòç
3236,"The bike might have found more acceptance if it hadn't entered the market as the successor to the CB1000R. But as radical and uncompromising as Honda has been with the recent Fireblade, the PowerNaked community is hoping for a suitably worthy modern CB1000R descendant. The CB650R can also serve the little demand for the design of the SC80. It works in its segment."
3237,"The last one already had full LED headlights and LEDs everywhere. The Quickshifter incl. Blibber was also included as standard in the Plus version. In my opinion, only optical updates were made, the cockpit was changed to a TFT display including connectivity and the engine was upgraded to Euro 5 via mapping. No more and no less."
3238,Would have liked a nicer design for the exhaust
3239,"I have the cb1000r sc80 from 2020 (subsequently converted to a black matte edition with clip-on handlebars ü•∞) with quickshifter (original retrofitted)... now I'm curious because that didn't come across very clearly. Has the driving behavior improved significantly or just the ""donate""? Is the 2021 translated shorter than the 2020? Is the new engine tuning just smoother or more powerful too?The first three gears are graded shorter. This brings significantly more punch out of the corners.Are the gears just shorter, or does the engine mapping mean that the torque comes a little earlier and more evenly? not only at 6000 and then quite violently as before?So if the 2021 is geared even shorter than the 2020s, that would put me off buying it. My 2020 is too short for me, especially on the Autobahn. 100 km/h in the sixth at 4,000 rpm. You're ready for a break after an hour."
3240,"All good, but what do you have with the TFT displays, I find them terrible, I don't want a (cheap) iPad on the motorcycle, the world is full of crap all around. What bet, in a few years everyone will have analogue speedometers and tachometers again, the way they should be. Motorcycling is something analog. The iPads can decorate the e-bikes. See the R-19, Kawa rs-900 or the new Hayabusa, that's the way it has to be. You Zonko in particular can't seriously tell me that you like it, sorry, but that was better with the old CB1000R...really good with the CB1100RS... "
3241,This is a beautiful naked bike.
3242,"The ""Black Edition"" looks fine. The exhaust, well, for E5 it might be compact, but somehow the new pots are almost all visually a lump. In any case, 145 hp should be completely sufficient. Unfortunately, the new Speedy also goes in the direction of overkill. who needs it.."
3243,"No IMU, no cornering ABS :( but nice bike .."
3244,"The bike might have found more acceptance if it hadn't entered the market as the successor to the CB1000R. But as radical and uncompromising as Honda has been with the recent Fireblade, the PowerNaked community is hoping for a suitably worthy modern CB1000R descendant. The CB650R can also serve the little demand for the design of the SC80. It works in its segment."
3245,"Rarely so emotional! Shifter ok. Should be adjustable in three stages. How should one imagine that? Also, tell me, is the Power 5 good for the iron? Nevertheless, thanks for the test, really great. Power 5 fits perfectly, the pressure of the shift assistant is adjustable."
3246,"Is the cable for the heated grips routed better?Unfortunately, she doesn't have one, only available as an accessory"
3247,"Zonko, are you missing sometime(somehow) cornering abs/traction control?ABS works very well, traction control too."
3248,Great bike but the retro look doesn't really appeal to me personally
3249,looks great in the black version! casual video
3250,snotty sound is something awesome!! Great bike right ?!! It would suit me and it's a no-brainer
3251,I bought the bike and I am very satisfied. 
3252,"A beautiful bike... will probably soon have to fight a battle with the CMX 1100 with DCT in my head. Heating or cruising comfortably... well, I can't decide."
3253,I totally agree... great machine but what bothers me are the rear-view mirrors. You can't see what's going on behind you.
3254,Nice bike until you read the price.
3255,"I just don't like the license plate mounted on the rear wheel, it's a shame that more and more manufacturers are doing it"
3256,somehow i just have the impression that the idiosyncratic shape of the neo cafe something design in black doesn't go so well comes across. I liked this matt gray (I think) from the predecessor ring a little better. otherwise the speed level when driving smoothly is a little too high for me... that sounds too ambitious for me... :D :D :D but as I can see it's tailored to the triendl. That's how it should be - a lid for every pot.
3257,"Really nice machine! But whether everything from kiddie shooters to Mercedes automobiles to motorcycles has to be ""black edition"" is questionable in my opinion."
3258,"Hello Zonko! You mentioned the new rear frame, did that change the seating position or seat height?Not my case. HONDA loses touch with the others, electronically and optically. I'm waiting for the CB-F Concert 1000 with a hopefully reasonable cockpit, cornering ABS, cruise control, between 150 and 175 hp and of course the weight should be taken into account. I'm sure Honda can only do that at the moment with little courage. Hopefully Honda doesn't fare like SUZUKI."
3259,A beautiful machine and very good review. The heated grips would be helpful in northern India region like in our side Delhi NCR sometimes we do feel the need of heated grips.
3260,A pure art by Honda‚ù§
3261,Honda did a great a job with styling this beauty but in hindsight I wanted to see reminisce of the older cb1000 I just liked those transformer'ish headlight
3262,The true power of the bike is unlocked in ‚ÄúUSER‚Äù mode when you turn off traction control and turn power to max. Good luck holding on
3263,I love this machine.
3264,Sound ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
3265,Insanely overpriced..14.5 Lakh on road
3266,"The bike is too good. But it is overpriced at 19 lakhs. It should have been around 10-14(on road) lakh rs. However thanks for the video, you are maybe the first Indian to make a video on this bike.It's a CBU,  we can't expect it under 15L üòädidn't knew it is an CBQ bike. But still it should have been under 15lakhs. It's ex-showroom price is 15lakh(internet). And it costed 19lakhs in Bangalore  that's too much.
Nice video though."
3267,This cb1000r speed tripe rs ducati cafe racer scrambler 1200 (don't know the exact number of ducati) and s1000r are the best in cafe racer look yea even speed triple coz why not new era of cafe racer
3268,Only 1 drawback of this bike that i cannot ignore is you will face a ton of wind blast on it
3269,Cb650r needed which people can actually afford
3270,Very gorgeous
3271,oh... she looks gorgeous....
3272,oh... she looks gorgeous....
3273,Tired of the neo retro design üòî
3274,"really bland and nothing really going for it, maybe I'd change my mind if i rode it as the engine and feeling may be its best poin"
3275,That exhaust sticks out too much! It doesn't complement the bike! üëé
3276,honda really need to work on its pricing... anyone would pick up a ninja 1000 which has better specs to offer in the same ltr class also easy and better after point of sale.
3277,"Great review! I just wish the front fender matched the tank, I was never a fan of matte finishes. Guess you could always have it painted.."
3278,Original exhaust looks way better.
3279,Great bike. Would have been better with a 2 cylinder engine.
3280,i would like to hear the sounds of this monster
3281,I'm not a Honda guy but....... I think this bike is the most beautiful naked bike of our era
3282,Good performance in a butt ugly design. The throwback look of the CB-F is where it is at man.
3283,It's a good bike but I just wish it wasn't so goddamn expensive.
3284,Nice looking bike but I feel it looks to small.
3285,Thing of beauty!
3286,The design looks like it came from the MV Agusta bikes
3287,Danggggg!! Need 400cc category same bike as 1000r. Single swing arm
3288,Oooow what a bike....nice
3289,Honda should make bikes for tall riders
3290,"It's so expensive compared to the competitors of the Kawasaki Z1000 600k, it's more than wow almost 900k"
3291,It‚Äôs like a cafe racer. I need one
3292,Those tall ass mirrors are terrible. Rid of those and this bike would look perfect
3293,But.....All the DISPLAYS ARE CRAP!!!!worst than some 125s is why I never get one!!!!!!!!
3294,Bad ass bike.
3295,Ducati Diavel clone
3296,Too small
3297,Superduke is better
3298,I'd rather choose yamaha XSR 900 than this
3299,Nice bike with good equipment at a fair price.
3300,"However aesthetically and really beautiful, especially the black, the engine, even if excellent for the road, stretches little to be a 4-cylinder (and to have 145 hp), a bike that I would buy if it wasn't really too expensive ... but this in general, all 1000 now new are unapproachable for those with family ... let's face it these bikes are just a whim ... and 15 bags for a whim ."
3301,"It's been like mine for almost a month but just 480km because of the weather it rains and I work, wonderful bike"
3302,"Great Hondas! Having in the East an overproduction of steel and aluminum and tax relief for the purchase by the Western market, they have been able to seize the opportunity and reinvest these materials by assembling them to their products, replacing the plastics with the noble satin aluminum. If metallurgical production continues and the market remains like this, let's also expect the license plate holder in perhaps anodized aluminum; ) The most suitable to show us the black edition could only be Count Privitacula! ;) ha ha! Joke, nice full presentation and nice video! "
3303,It is really beautiful üòç
3304,"Very nice. It has the proportions of the first M900 monastery of the 90s, or at least it reminds me a lot."
3305,Definitely interesting bike !!!! Bad only the plate holder that ruins it in its beautiful aesthetics !!!
3306,"Beautiful bike. I have had the previous model for two years. Engine comfort and wonderful aesthetics, but for me it had 3 flaws: annoying vibrations on the handlebars at highway speeds; rear suspension not up to par; monotrave frame in my opinion not very stable. I agree with the comment of many that for the list price one would expect more, given what the competition offers."
3307,"In addition to being beautiful with an almost ""timeless"" beauty, it does not have a thousand thousand horses ... .but who can tell '); the only thing I do not understand (perhaps for reasons of age ... both motorcycling and personal data ...) is the ""fixation"" of the quickshift .... I can understand it on very high performance bikes to be exploited especially on the track in search of the ""time"" .... but on motorcycles of ""daily"" use I just don't understand it, PS: black is beautiful but ... the black bike in Sicily just NO ... July / August ... state ... 40 degrees ... nonononono !!!"
3308,A beautiful bike
3309,"Disappointing the lack of abs cornering even if knowing honda you find yourself with an excellent product for driveability. Then how ugly these bikes, all black and in colored version, often only have the tank. At least the tail, a tip ... The new gsx suzuki makes a good impression with the colors and has the abs cornering"
3310,Beautiful bike very cool and compressed
3311,Gorgeous
3312,"Had the cb 1000 r 2018 plus + beautiful bike, elegant but not suitable for the engine it has ... The single beam frame in sports driving always comes out even if the suspensions are replaced as I had it done ... Then the resale is very low either you trade it in or sell it under the price it has. I have been on the track for over 25 years and I would like to change the bike that I use exclusively on the street. I would like to switch from the current 848 evo to a naked as a matter of comfort (the over 40s feel this especially on very long laps), so do you advise against it for sporty road driving? Very sporty driving .... I was enticed by the price and the line but, I'm afraid, a not very sporty chassis"
3313,"They did a little bit of what I will do but it is aesthetically wonderful, more beautiful than the most essential ducati moster, beautiful I like it very much ... Ps the only flaw is the interface with the phone ... There is a need for privacy üîè in the world .. ."
3314,Aesthetically very bad because honda is not selling in this segment ... NB I have owned 3 Honda a kawasaki and a Suzuki ..
3315,"The bike is a sculpture, nothing is out of place, almost absent plastics, the construction level is from MV. The only flaw: Apple smartphones are not supported."
3316,too much money too expensive.
3317,These digital displays really make me shit. 
3318,"Too bad the little market it has and the poor resale, at least x the previous model. The price seems exaggerated to me for this version."
3319,"If we consider that it was the best-selling maxinaked in Italy in 2018 and 2019, to say that it has little market does not seem very appropriate"
3320,I sincerely hope it will end soon this wheel license plate fashion
3321,"15,000 euros and .... absence of the complete inertial platform, non-adjustable clutch lever, a bier as a plate holder and last but not least single beam frame ..... and this would be the Honda 1000 cc motorcycle. naked of 2021 ????? But who are they kidding ?????? I would like to know where you got the data you read below: Best-selling naked bikes in 2018 and 2019 !!!! From Motoblog 8 Jan. 2020 in the ranking of the 20 best-selling bikes in Italy, the Honda CB1000R does not even appear ... Good road to everyone"
3322,An aesthetic fantasy of the Madonna !!! It is an MV Agusta with the Honda logo
3323,A real FLOP this bike ever since it came out. It devalues ‚Äã‚Äãthat it is a pleasure ......
3324,I would never change the wonderful sound of a Honda 4 cylinder motorcycle.
3325,I'm not touching the exhaust. It screams if you ride it in the right revs. Looks great also. No need to spend the extra money.
3326,Not with the license plate hanging off the swingarm like a ballsack! Worst styling trend in motorbike history!!!
3327,"I thought I might like a Cb1000r, I rode the previous one, which I liked, but the newer one seemed less raw. That was between going from a BMW r1200r to a ktm 790 duke, I like twins and fours don't always do it for me somehow."
3328,Quick shifter is a gimmick. Very very easy to shift without clutch Heated grips would be cool though 
3329,"Thanks!The single swing-arm does require special considerations:1. an additional side-lift purchase for doing any service work.2. Also, I'm not very convinced if the single swing-arm design will be as stable as a dual swing-arm design since the weight of the bike is leaning only on one side.3. What about safety issue for this kind of design?No safety issues with them. Honda and Ducati have been using them and racing with them for years and years."
3330,No safety issues with them. Honda and Ducati have been using them and racing with them for years and years.
3331,"I like the look of it, but not adding the unsprung mass"
3332,"A lot of people have commented on the rear shock but you can improve it with adjustment but some fit a stiffer sportier rear shock to make it more track orientated. Like you I like the black edition but I do not like the matt black down pipes. It looks lovely in the red also and would probably be my preference if I were to purchase one. Take care mate.Yeah, I wish I'd fettled with the suspension a bit now but still a fantastic bike. Cheers!"
3333,Ps the only flaw is the interface with the phone ... There is a need for privacy üîè in the world .. .Great review Dan I just bought the Black Edition and your right about the indicators switch wrong place. The only change I will do is replace the fly screen for a Puig fly screen.
3334,The single beam frame in sports driving always comes out even if the suspensions are replaced as I had it done ... Then the resale is very low either you trade it in or sell it under the price it has.Cool bike. Honda‚Äôs are always super reliable. The color highlight looks quite a bit like the XDiavel Black S.
3335,"hen how ugly these bikes, all black and in colored version, often only have the tank"
3336,Stunning urban design +Smooth operation+Tech options & quick shifter-Vanilla instrument display-Busy Wheel design limits security lock options-Polarizing headlamp styling-Too much power for daily usability-Shifter takes away from rider-machine connection experience Just my initial impressions/opinions.
3337,Honestly this bike is a BARGAIN. Buying a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù bike in this category would cost quite a bit more
3338,I think I prefer the original headlight. Wish they'd do more colours in the black edition....
3339,"Having in the East an overproduction of steel and aluminum and tax relief for the purchase by the Western market, they have been able to seize the opportunity and reinvest these materials by assembling them to their products, replacing the plastics with the noble satin aluminum.

Joke, nice full presentation and nice video!God the whole new CB range looks so damn good, I have a cb300r but man the 650 looks enticing"
3340,"In my opinion, the more forward-loaded riding position compared to the previous version is not to be considered a requirement regardless, as not all motorcyclists prefer it.I like the smoothness of ""rainmode"" as well."
3341,I think I prefer the original headlight. Wish they'd do more colours in the black edition....
3342,That's a beauty indeed. üòÅüòç
3343,"It is such a beautiful bike. I was just too scared of the power and took the CB650R. I love the radiator pipes in black. ""Get on your side you f..[...] yeah the suspension"". Ride safe "
3344,Gorgeous bike !
3345,"I am not into sport bikes, but this one is really beautiful."
3346,Great looking bike!
3347,This bike has really caught my eye.
3348,"I think they could have made a dark mode for the screen, especially for this bike being the black edition"
3349,BEAST üòç
3350,My dream motorcycle
3351,What a beautiful bike.
3352,hat's a really beautiful motorcycle for a Japanese one
3353,that bike looks a beast :P
3354,"The headlight looks like a lucky horseshoe to me, sold."
3355,Exhaust is a shame and is so big that you can't even fully see the beautifully made rear wheel. üòï
3356,Beautiful‚ù§
3357,"Cool looking bike! Heh about swingarm number plate holders, people will complain no matter where it's located. Many of them have the luxury of living in places with great weather, so they can put a tail-tidy on their bikes without much trade-offs. Or are just fair-weather riders (which is fine, riding in the rain etc. can suck ). But for people who ride in bad weather, whether their bike is their only means of transport or just for the thrill of it, it's as close you can get to a compromise on a good-looking rear-end and a functional splashguard, at least with motorcycle regulations being a pain in the ass to design around."
3358,I'm a user and fan of naked bikes and do like the look of this bike
3359,"i'm not going to lie, i'm not a fan of this, i absolutely love the CB range as i have a cb125r myself, but it seems like they've just gone down a weird path making this one unfortunately"
3360,üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
3361,Sick bike
3362,Needs more cross plane.
3363,such a buietifull bike and they put this smartphone screen in front
3364,headlight looks like my toilet bowl üëç
3365,What a thing indeed.
3366,Just don‚Äôt like the headlight looks too cute wish it looked mean
3367,"Great looking motorcycle, but why every car/motorcycle manufacturer tends to slap screens??? I hate this trend, makes them all same and bland"
3368,It looks like old Steam train
3369,"Nice bike dude,"
3370,That fly screen does NOTHING
3371,I'd prefer black headers over poor quality cheap chrome or steel that rapidly rusts and turns poo brown anyday.
3372,"Even the best headers end up turning poo brown eventually, unless you bleach clean them. There's no escaping oxidisation. So yeah, black headers for the win!"
3373,It sounds like vacuum cleaner...
3374,the headlight is dope.
3375,"The styling of the Naked Honda Caf√© Range is my favorite out there for sure. Sleek, Modern and Classis altogether and especially a fan of the Halo front light. I love this CB1000R but for me the CB650R is the one that ticks all the boxes as a commuter and especially considering the price difference between it and the 1000R it just makes much more sense. "
3376,Finally this is a desirable bike. The details are stunning. This bike is the epitome of Honda build quality üëçüèª
3377,"I‚Äôve put 10,000 km on my black edition so far, and I love this bike. I think it‚Äôs a great street bike. I know people are going to complain that is lower in power than the mt10 and the other super nakeds but it‚Äôs not a slow bike and on the street it keeps up, so what if the super sport liter bikes get to the next light a second ahead of you, you‚Äôre still there with them."
3378,What a gorgeous motorcycle! Seems fast enough to me plus Honda quality fit and finish.
3379,beautiful looking motorcycle!
3380,Beautiful bike! 
3381,", the cb1000r in both the latest generation and older model, use the engine from the 2006/2007 CBR1000RR Fireblade, , the reason for this is because the 06/07 uses a 56.5mm stroke compared to the 08 which became more over square with a 55.1mm stroke, the longer stroke engine being obviously better at producing a more thrusty and torquey bike at lower to midrange speeds due to the longer piston stroke"
3382,This bike suffers from heavy neutering in the first 3 gears and is limited up top as well. Also the 5.5k rpm flat spot for emissions. 
3383,"I've got the 2020 model in the UK and I have to agree with your comment regarding the flat spot between 5.5k and 7.5k RPM. A full exhaust system with ECU remap eradicates this issue and a throttle map helps massively too. Good thing in the UK is that motorbikes can have the catalytic converter removed and it still be road legal! I've seen from dyno figures you'll gain around 20rwhp in that flat range and around 10rwhp overall. That literally transforms the bike, it'll be a wheelie monster up to 3rd gear for sure."
3384,"it has like, 145hp, doesn't it? (so its more like, MT-10/S1000R/z1000 territory with regards to HP.... I do love the look of the bike, and even the swingarm mounted licence holder, I LOVE bikes with single sided swing arm, and the black edition. Oh, its beautiful. I'm picking one of (talking myself into it!) I OH, andthe new TFT, quickshifter up/down, and those wheels! they look awesome!. I think I just talked myself into one."
3385,"1) NO wind-protection 2) NO carrying capacity 3) HIGH footpegs. CONCLUSION: Day Tripper, ONLY"
3386,"I can't help but notice how incredibly ugly the rear wheel is because it uses lug nuts, every single sided swingarm out there uses a single lock nut but for some reason Honda decided lugnuts were a good idea... It totally takes away from the concept of a ""premium"" motorcycle for me, makes it look like they forgot a way to attach the rear wheel and just slapped it on afterwards. To me it's less of a ground-up build from Honda for the naked bike segment and more of a mash of an old sportbike that didn't sell well, the VFR lineup, and some of their cafe styled bike parts from the 1100 all combined their leftover parts to create this bike. If Honda would just dive into the super-naked segment and toss their new fireblade engine, frame, and suspension into an upright naked styled bike they would have a very solid competitor but they refuse to do it for some reason."
3387,Front fender sucks! I know I own it.
3388,"That screen is small. Agree...needs proper, 'classic clocks' that are consistent with the rest of the bike's aesthetic. Kawasaki did it correctly with their 900‚Ä¶"
3389,The silver elements on the engine look like butt.
3390,Most boring naked bike
3391,Too much black. It‚Äôs just a giant mass of black.
