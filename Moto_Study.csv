It has everything which you advise the Triumph RS SPEED TRIPLE HAS but delivers it better it has a 6.5 TFT screen which is far easier to use than the Triumph and has more information. The bike is set up like the Triumph for a sportier ride as you are encouraged to have a slight lean forward towards the flat bars whilst offering a slightly more open riding triangle (seat you move on back to front and lean off) which alongside the cruise control, heated grips, up/ down shifter, hill hold  assist, self cancelling indicators and 80% of 111 Nm/ 86 ft/lb torque coming in from 3,000 makes (165 bhp at 11,000 revs) the bike suitable for commuting/ city riding, longer journeys and as you would put it canyon carving (I live in the UK). I have mine in racing red with red stripe on the wheels and choose to add  the Tyre Pressure Monitoring System all backed up by a 3 yr Warranty from BMW and an excellent dealer network. I am constantly attracting positive comments from passersby which is nice to hear others appreciate your bike but even if that did not happen the smile I get before, during and after riding my bike, the pops and crackles that happen when in Dynamic Pro mode (there are 4 riding modes Pro being customisable to your personal needs) just makes me giggle.

My only two issues with the bike are first and foremost, it is an absolute proper pain in the ass to get into neutral and secondly I wished that Triumph had given us just 1 extra litre capacity for petrol as it's only 15.5 litres, however that seems to be the way all manufacturers are going unless you buy a touring bike.

Shame that Triumph took such a successful blend of power, looks and plush road abilities, and turned the (only new) version into a primarily track-focused bike that, it seems doesn't have the charm, all-round abilities and enjoyment that the outgoing versions had.

I had everything original on it and the saddle was already super comfortable, engine noise super original exhaust and airbox, and the shifter is cool even if I shift gears quite high to the shifter below I find that it is not good for the gearbox and when descending I prefer use the clutch to control the release of torque. Afterwards I had my feet on the ground for 1m72 and super light for parking maneuvers at the same time I ride a Shiver 900 so everything I try seems light and low saddle 😁 I would say that the Yamaha engine on the chassis of the Triumph it is ideal, I find that it lacks sensations at legal speed.",,,,France,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86

,Triumph,Street Triple RS and R,,,"As owner: Pro: - driving position: the front end feels good even though it does not have a loaded position like a super sports car, you don't get tired even after 400-450 km laps (a minimum of pain in the legs because they feel slightly too much folded, I'm 1.80 tall). - powerful and modular braking, it could be even better if the radial pump remained instead of the axial nissin, very good braided hoses (jap take a cue) - engine: wonderful delivery (at any speed and in any gear you don't feel the need to downshift), nice sound to be euro5, in the mountains with third gear you do what you want (from 3000 to 12000 rpm the engine always pulls), too bad the excessive on-off on the gas especially in second gear and in the sports map .




- finishes: the bike is really well made to cost 10k, some small imperfections on the control blocks On the handlebar, more than forgivable - gearbox: fast and easy to maneuver, the quickshifter is a wonderful gem in sports driving to eliminate change times gear. -heat: the bike warms up very little if you are dressed in technical clothing (I have no experience with short clothes, if it were up to me I would forbid to ride on two wheels in ""beach"" clothes), only a slight warm-up of the right foot due to the exhaust (probably eliminated with an aftermarket muffler)


-Diablo Rosso 3 original equipment: great folds, excellent wet and wet behavior, good resistance to the motorway, it is not obvious to find such a suitable tire already fitted as original equipment. Cons: - standard rear mono adjustment: probably due to my weight (80 kg dressed) it tends to pump excessively on the undulations of the asphalt, especially in the pronounced folds, excellent move by Triumph to write in the booklet the recommended calibrations on the base the type of use. - autonomy: the combination of a small tank and low fuel consumption will force you to refuel every 200-220 km of happy driving.




- aerodynamic protection: this is to be expected from a naked, forget long motorway sections at over 110 km / h, the aftermarket fairings do not improve much if you are tall. In general I recommend this bike, I do not find the RS 2020/21 version very sensible for the following reasons: - I don't see the 2000 euro justified: the showa fork of the RS is scarce like that of the R, the 5 HP of the engine are only mapping . With that money difference we get radial pump, mono, front forks and map of much higher quality. -TFT display: the tachometer of the RS is something ridiculous to the nth level, totally illegible",,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2A27zKsa5U,Italy,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,76

Twist it as hard as you want, the ECU will only deliver 80% power past 7k on the tach.

Look, I also answer you as an owner in the meantime, since I read, the delay initially bothered me too who was used to enduro, but you get used to it very quickly, and it is annoying only at the start in the end, vibrations there are at high revs, let's say you feel from 8,000 upwards a little more, they don't bother me too much personally.

To clarify, the Continental is not the fastest of the road sports cars. The Power 5, on the other hand, I did not like that much due to the excessive aggressiveness of the front profile, while the Bridgestone S22 are quite similar to the SportAttack 4.

,Ducati,Streetfighter V4s,,,"Thanks puma. Even before its release it incensed the spirits compared to the 1098 which we already knew and which continues to be high placed. The big difference with this V4 and we can see it is the mechanical extension. V2 1098 breaks in 10K, V4 in 14K. As a result, we see that the reduction of the pistons (4 instead of two big ones) makes it possible to give more power, at higher speeds, with conservation of the foot at the back for the low and middle speeds. Because the V2 1098 also, contrary to what one might think for a bi twin, is explosive at the top. The v4 is more modern, more secure while offering much more. They wanted to do even more than the tuono or the big katoche, it's done. But of the opinion all the same that there, as for the sports ones, it also smells of the swan song. In the sense or what will the next ones do to offer even more? I'm not talking about the moralizing side of the style, what's the point blah blah... everyone is free and we're big kids. I'm talking about the fact that with ecology, downsizing has not affected motorcycles (wink Rocket III) and above all, no hybridization yet. But given how autophobic contexts, to the point of no longer liking modern cars (those that are exciting are impregnable because of the eco-boho malus that targets a minority, but penalizes everyone without changing anything to the global problems of ecologies because laid by ignorant mechanics), we are still spared the bikers because much less numerous. But in the long term honestly, the work of performances will not be able to continue in this way of more hp! the weight ? The safe facility? road comfort? Otherwise, on aesthetics: in short. She rocks; as often with Ducati. And above all, these are designs that last. If we take the 1098, clearly it looks ""old"" compared to the V4, but in good condition it remains sexy. Ditto for the 916, the 1098 sbk, the monster sr4 etc.....Audi must leave them this imprint, because for their cars, they have this annoying habit of commercially killing stylistically, the new model on the old one (example , the 1st a3, the a4, the a5 etc).",,,,France,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86

As for the much-discussed fins, they offer greater stability to the front end, weighing on it with an important aerodynamic load, as if it were squeezed between the fairing and the tank along a straight line.

If I'm buying a bike that costs this much then I want it to have the best of all that regardless if it is usable 95% of the time or not.

They should be doing exactly what they are doing....producing the most capable bike they possibly can.
You missed my point. Companies can build what they want and you can buy it. It's not silly or stupid  (your words) to question the fitness for use the purpose of this model. The problem for this bike that it isnt the best shifting,  doesn't have the sharpest brakes or tires nor is it tuned particularly well for the street.

It's made as a more road-going (more comfortable, slightly detuned) version of a race bike but realistically, there's nowhere other than a track you can use its capability. I suppose if you can have only one bike for street and track, OK - but if you're buying a $25K Ducati, you can afford two bikes. There are better road bikes and better track bikes. Especially with tires, if you're a serious track guy (and a 200BHP $25K mistake is serious), you'll want track rubber. I am glad they exist because they are gorgeous, I just don't really see the practical application. Give me a basic 700-800 ADV for the road and a 600RR for the track and (maybe, rubber permitting) canyons - similar investment but a better result.

The counter: not everything is displayed, but everything is ''findable'' via the top left button (A) on the counter. Not practical I grant you, but as you say, we are not on such a machine to watch the counter!! Rear shock absorber: this is adjustable using the knob placed under the seat on the right side, very easy to access. You can choose to ride ''leisure'' with soft shock or ''racing'' with hard shock. There is a large adjustment range. For the two shock absorbers (front-rear), they are adjustable in preload and rebound. Yes, it's an old-fashioned motorcycle, for ''the real ones''. It's either you can master yourself and master it or you buy a modern motorcycle with all the electronic gear and you do the cake, not a real biker. If we call ourselves a biker, then we control our vehicle alone, regardless of the conditions. The original tires sound blah. I switched to Michelin road 5. Personally I find the rear brake ''light'', it serves me above all to stabilize in curves if necessary. At the front, on the other hand, it slows down for real, that's the best. I ride a 2019 Z1000R and I slightly modified it: Akrapovic exhaust line which saves me 10 kg (so same weight as the 900Z), 6.4 n/m at 8500 rpm, 11 CV (going to 153) at 10 000 laps (not easy to pick them up on the open road).

Mounted the Hurric Pro 2 which are also short stumps like yours! Before my current Conti Road Attack 3, I had a Bridgestone S21 on it, which made it much easier to tilt into corners. Dare to say that I hardly had to push at all compared to the Road Attack, but the grip of the Conti simply convinced me, so I don't mind the additional ""work"" on the bike. I have one more question: If you accelerate in first gear up to 7000 RPM and then disengage the clutch, does the gear really howl with you?

Monster 1200 customers will never buy this and sales of the 821 were confidential.

Why is the new frame hidden like this? If the lower tank line had been left straight and the aluminum frame had been painted red or even anodized, it would have been a damn strong signal. And still closer to the traditional monster design. Shame about the missed opportunity. Driving better than the old one wasn't difficult anyway.",,,,Germany,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86
,Ducati,Monster,,,", the fact that the Monster has gone back to its roots in terms of frames and has adopted the Superbike concept, as was the case with the M900 and the 851 back then, is something that most snots who get upset about the fact that there is no tubular space frame don't get more there. The new Monster also has a very distinctive character and I think there is really only one motorcycle in this class that can even come close to keeping up with it: The KTM 890 Duke! The rest don't stand a chance! Forget the Yamaha MT-09 and I think the comparison tests will show that! I can only repeat myself: the new one wasn't designed for this kind of ""cast-iron"" monster fans! For these classic fans, Ducati continues to build the Scrambler models, which are air-cooled and still have trellis tubes. That's why the fan boys should really give it a rest and either continue to drive their old Monster models or just grab the Scrambler. Above all, the new Monster is aimed at those riders who, like the KTM 890 Duke and the Street Triple, are looking for a light and super handy motorcycle that doesn't necessarily want killer performance, but simply optimal performance on country roads should deliver performance! And EXACTLY THAT is what Ducati has done brilliantly! The new Monster would kill an 821 on the highway, it drives COMPLETELY different than before! And now that I've heard the monsters again and also heard the drives past in the video, I'm reconciled again. The sound designer at Ducati does NOT need to be fired. He just made the bike comfortably quiet. But if you open the throttle while driving, you still have a rich V2 sound, even if it sounds a bit thin when stationary. I think the new Monster will be a great success for Ducati.

,Ducati,Monster,,,"I want to say that 3rd gen Monster, is a proper monster, first because it looks like a monster, and then because it has multiple engines, not a single engine like the 937. Even the first gen Monster, the good old S4RS has a superbike engine with 130hp, full ohlins suspension.... It's a full one ""Monster"" of a naked bike... The new Monster is a middle weight toy, it went downmarket. Even the brakes are out of a 2014 Monster 821. For context, KTM puts Brembo Stylema in the 890R, that's the superbike brakes that the Panigale V4R has + fully adjustable WP suspension. As for looks, regardless if you like or not, this doesn't look like a Monster, a Monster has a certain aesthetics, just like the Porsche 911 has. You looks at Porsche 911, regardless if it's from 1964 or 2021, it looks like a 911, it's instantly recognizeable as a 911... The Monster used the be Ducati's 911, but now it looks like a japanese bike...",,,,Philippines,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86
,Ducati,Monster,,,"The original Monster was only a 900 the first year, and it didn't get the superbike engine until 8 years later. 2nd gen started with the 696, 1100 the next year, and the 796 2 more years later. Similar story with the 3rd gen, with the 1200 announced first, followed by the 821 the next year. All this is to say it's far too soon to know if this is the only engine option, or even the only spec that will be available. I suspect an upmarket version with high-end suspension and maybe a single-sided swingarm will come soon. You need to chill out about the 3rd gen Monsters - they barely have a trellis frame (as if that counts for anything) and are oversized, overweight cows of a bike - they're fast, but power isn't everything. They are the outlier in the Monster lineage and not the high water mark. The trellis frame was not anything special - it's just what Ducati had on hand. Since you bring up 911s, you sound like someone who thought the 996 wasn't a real 911 because it went liquid cooled.",,,,Philippines,NEU,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86

For a street rider this is a definite win. Sure the MT10 will go very fast, but with the upright sitting position it isn't very fun for a prolonged period. Pulling out of a fast sweeping corner in 3rd and feeling that incredible pull while the front wheel lofts is where this bike shines.

,BMW,S1000r,,,"I always thought that, even if I can arm the electronic helpers, they regulate a lot less than, for example, in road mode (eg: abs works but much later.""

Because the babble has nothing to do with ""safety-relevant settings"" such as wheelie control & abs ... That would be great if that would work like this! 😀",,,,Germany,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86
,BMW,S1000r,,,"""Engine mapping"" refers to the basic tuning of the engine. In this specific case, it is about the throttle response, i.e. how many degrees the throttle valve is opened at how many degrees the throttle grip position. In RAIN the throttle response is soft, in the other modes it is direct. In addition, the available torque depends on the engine mapping depending on the gear. In RAIN we cap the maximum torque in the lowest 3 gears, in ROAD and DYNAMIC in the lowest 2 gears, in DYNAMIC PRO in no gear. How so? Quite simply, if the driver tells the moped that it is wet and slippery, for example by selecting ""RAIN"" mode, it makes no sense to release engine power that we know from the start will be too great for the available grip. Just imagine ""Grip"" can be a number between 0 (ice surface) and 100 (racing slicks on race track asphalt): the traction control must constantly guess the right number within this range (or approach it: ""Is the number greater than 55? Yes! Is it greater than 91? No! Greater than 68? Yes! Greater than 70? No! OK: Allow 69 pieces of power!!""). By choosing the right mode, you make life much easier for traction control. It is told, for example, by RAIN that only a number between 0 and 10 will be plausible in first gear. Therefore we cap the torque for all areas where numbers >10 would be reached. So the chance of guessing the correct ""traction number"" is no longer 1:100, but1:10. This enables significantly finer, faster and more precise control. Our WSBK guys were so confident that they wanted to use these algorithms when it was still very early in development. Anyway, I digress. In ROAD and DYNAMIC we cap less torque because ROAD is designed for safe driving in dry conditions and DYNAMIC for dynamic driving in dry conditions (the parameters for ABS, electronic damping, etc. also change at the same time, but that would go beyond the scope) . The engine mapping in ROAD and DYNAMIC is identical. Depending on the gear, we allow as much power that optimal acceleration is achieved. The difference between the two driving modes is that the wheelie and ABS rules, which are also linked, are different. ROAD always keeps the wheels on the ground, while DYNAMIC allows the front wheel (rear wheel) to lift slightly when accelerating (braking) for maximum performance. So if you configure DYNAMIC PRO to be everything like ROAD, just the sharpest motor mapping (the DYNAMIC PRO mapping) is selected, then it will also behave like ROAD (wheelie control will prevent wheelies, ABS will be designed for stability, traction control will be for mixed grip conditions in dry conditions). The only difference is that the torque is NOT cut in the first two gears - so you make life harder for traction control and wheelie control (= always have to guess a number between 0 and 100), but they will still protect you. And yes, you have the thrust bubbles with you.",,,,Germany,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,90

I would like to point out that the Dynamic Pro map has unlocked torque while Road and Dynamic have reduced torque in the first 3 gears. Have you tried the Dynamic Pro? Isn't it that the impression of the lower midrange boost also comes from the noise emasculated by the Euro5, while the old one was much nastier in terms of sound?

The electronics have problems (serious and I hope they solve them for me), the supply is unmanageable. Below 4000 it disassembles, above it is a bull. The engine brake is intense up to 4000 rpm, if it drops below that speed then it sails (nice to be without support in the middle of the curve). Not to mention the ABS that enters all corners with a slightly bent bike and then stops braking and sends you into the other lane. To make you understand, I'm using it without any control because I'm afraid. Ah, I found the gear lever dangling, thank goodness I did not lose the pin because otherwise I had to call the wrecker. Yes, you have to tighten the screws like the Ducatis of 20 years ago. On the 30th I have an appointment in KTM but I can't wait to take it out. And I didn't take Aprilia for fear of having problems.

Of the S1000R I regret the fluidity of the engine at the bottom in every gear and the priceless barrels at the exhaust, but for the rest for me the orange is another world ... and then again for me the twin cylinder is the motorcycle engine par excellence.

Bmw had an embarrassing fluidity at all revs and all gears, this is the opposite. But really I am driving with the fear of dying. If I've gotten to the point of overriding all controls on such a monster, you can understand my situation. I may have taken the wrong specimen, but I paid for it in full so I hope KTM recognizes the problem because I am in crisis. The moment they tell me they've done an update, I won't feel safe anyway. Too bad because every time I come back in the evening, I would like to leave and go get me a gas. And in any case it will be quicker to get into the fold, but with the S1000 you took the gas in your hand very much earlier, without the fear that it would throw you into hyperspace.

The main complains for me were front end instability at high speeds and the vibrations through the bar. I could live with that. But I could never live with the soulless engine. I have never ridden an electric bike but i guess the S1000R is quite close to the sensations of an electric motorcycle. It is so bland.

,BMW,S1000r,,,"The flat spot in the new BMWs (and other bikes) aren’t really due to Euro5 – the Euro bikes don’t have the flat spot – but mostly due to EPA sound emission regulations, which are stricter than Euro. Manufacturers respond by closing the exhaust valve in lower RPM and limiting throttle/fueling in the certification testing range, among other things. I have 15K miles on my 2020 S1000RR. I got mine a bit before you did. My guess is that you would have had a different opinion and outcome had you installed the Brentuning (now BT-Moto) tune because it totally transforms the bike. It not only deletes the flat spot, but unleashes the shiftcam for more power throughout (relative to Euro), gives better sound, better fueling, better idle, quicker shifts, etc. Wow! The teething problems are also a bit overblown. Mine had recalls replacing the oil cooler and front calipers, but those were done seamlessly at the 6K and 12K services. No problems otherwise. It’s been my best purchase ever. I understand the frustration over the inability to change settings (suspension, anti-wheelie, engine braking, etc.) on the fly, but the many configurable elements require a deeper dive through TFT menus, and BMW’s Teutonic OCD wants to prevent you from changing these while moving. However, it’s mostly an initial setup annoyance, at least for a particular track, where you can set RACE PRO 1-3 with different ranges of settings you think likely good and switch between them while riding. At least BMW later issued a software update that enabled Bluetooth data telemetry to the phone app for some Data Logging capability in RACE PRO modes. I haven’t ridden the new R, but the new XR is outstanding. I think the R and XR have the same engine and tune. They improved almost everything a little bit, and that accumulates to a big overall improvement. I do have minor complaints such as the too-soft ROAD mode that makes me never to use anything less than DYNAMIC, but so what",,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei5U3t2Mw5M,USA,P,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,86

,Suzuki,GSX S1454,,,I've been unable to make up my mind what I'll get for years. At first I wanted the old CB1000R but couldn't get one then I thought I might just get the suzuki because it may actually be a slightly better bike even though they could have made it look better. The snatchy throttle wouldn't have bothered me because I kind of like taming a light switch where it's either on or off. The main thing that concerned me was tall gearing as I do most of my riding inner city commute. I had an 08 street triple 675 which was perfect for my ride but it got stolen twice in a row so I gave up. Now I'm really in love with the look of the new honda cb1000r especially since it was revised and is now all black. Problem with that is I think it probably lacks a little on the power compared to competition and I found it was a little high and the square seat kinda hurt the inside of my legs just testing it inside the shop. I also see myself caring too much about it and looks like a nightmare to keep clean. Now they have finally revised the suzuki but I sort of dislike the new headlight even though I liked the headlight on the new MT09. I think if the suzuki has revised the gearing it'll be a no brainer but the MT09 and the CB1000R are still on my radar.

Did they use the staircase for inspiration when they were designing the headlight? Haha! It looks like the new MT09 which is (in my opinion) one of the ugliest bikes ever designed! Anyhow, I think they should have taken the DNA from the new GSX-R1000 and build up the new GSX-S from there. Reusing the same sharp tail, that sleek headlight with a thin led-stripe on each side, same suspension, and of course engine. I rather spend my money on the new S1000R for a couple of thousand more!

As far as the tank is concerned, I would like to correct you briefly: It's not that small because it's so flat: The air intake tract is under the ""tank"" cover, the petrol tank is under the seat. This contributes to the fact that the FTR is so easy to handle despite the high weight. By the way, you had the display in night mode the whole time, in day mode it is easier to read in daylight. It cannot be operated exclusively via the touchscreen, but alternatively either via the buttons directly on the display or while riding via the control buttons on the handlebars. bluetooth connectivity, the driving modes and features such as cruise control are gimmicks, but the overall package on a high-quality basis is quite appropriate for the price - compared to motorcycles in the same class. The driving assistants (ABS and traction control) are curve-sensitive. By the way, the seat height is 840cm and cannot be adjusted differently. Alternatively, there is a flat tracker seat in the accessories catalogue. This probably gets you to the 805 cm seat height you've heard of.

Is there such a big gap between the two? Thank you in advance!",Comparison,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r41dwNEZ5jE&t=5s,France,P,AGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,100
,Honda,CB1000R,,,"Apart from the engine, the biggest difference is felt in fast curves where the 1000 is more stable and therefore encourages you to pass harder: In turns the 1000 is more lively and at the same time more stable than the 650, so it lands more easily but requires a bit more commitment to rectify a trajectory. At low speed the 1000 also seems more agile to me, possibly because of the tighter caster angle but especially the profile of the tires. The damping is also significantly better on the 1000: The rear in particular, even if it is set a little soft when leaving the factory, makes it possible to better maintain the wheel on the ground in bumpy turns where in these same turns the 650 tended to twitch (gently). The braking is comparable I find, there is probably a little more attack on the 1000 but the feeling is very similar. Comfort, especially in duo (according to my wife) is better on the 1000 mainly due to a more padded and slightly more spacious saddle. The riding positions are comparable, we are slightly further forward on the 1000. Finally, the engine is what separates the two bikes the most, firstly because the 1000 allows you to roll up in all circumstances with always enough by force whatever the traffic where the 650 sometimes asks to go down one or two gears but also because above 6000 rpm we find the somewhat on/off temperament of the 650 but in a much wilder way. In the end, the 1000 is the same philosophy as the 650 with the bar placed higher on each criterion. That being said, the 650 is a really great bike that I can't say enough about personally. Completely consistent, healthy, well equipped, efficient... I don't see any gap between the 650 and the 1000, but the second as an improvement on the first.

The 650 is a great choice in A, whether you're ""young A"" or not, the reason I switched to the 1000 is that I do less town (where the 1000 is a little oversized) than before and then, it's a little whim to be honest but the 650 is really a great wheel, you'll have fun with it.

,Honda,CB1000R,,,", the cb1000r in both the latest generation and older model, use the engine from the 2006/2007 CBR1000RR Fireblade, , the reason for this is because the 06/07 uses a 56.5mm stroke compared to the 08 which became more over square with a 55.1mm stroke, the longer stroke engine being obviously better at producing a more thrusty and torquey bike at lower to midrange speeds due to the longer piston stroke",,,,USA,N+,DISAGREEMENT,SUBJECTIVE,92

,Honda,CB1000R,,,"I've got the 2020 model in the UK and I have to agree with your comment regarding the flat spot between 5.5k and 7.5k RPM. A full exhaust system with ECU remap eradicates this issue and a throttle map helps massively too. Good thing in the UK is that motorbikes can have the catalytic converter removed and it still be road legal! I've seen from dyno figures you'll gain around 20rwhp in that flat range and around 10rwhp overall.

It totally takes away from the concept of a ""premium"" motorcycle for me, makes it look like they forgot a way to attach the rear wheel and just slapped it on afterwards. To me it's less of a ground-up build from Honda for the naked bike segment and more of a mash of an old sportbike that didn't sell well, the VFR lineup, and some of their cafe styled bike parts from the 1100 all combined their leftover parts to create this bike.
